0,"I, Tonya",7,7 December 2017,Tabloid Times,"I was going to make a list of people who made extraordinary things during the same period that Tonya Harding monopolized the headlines but then I thought it was a pointless exercise. Charles Manson will always be more famous, much more than Sharon Tate. That's the world we live in or maybe it always was. The sadness verging on horror of of the Tonya Harding story will win, fascination wise, than any kind of kindness from anyone anywhere. Now that out of my system let me say that I Tonya is an entertaining harrowing tale directed by Craig Gillespie and his extraordinary cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis with, clearly, Martin Scorsese in their minds and hearts. Margot Robbie is terrific and Sebastian Stan as the husband from hell, superb but it's Allison Janney that creates a character that is impossible to take and irresistible at the same time. She is spectacular. So, that's more than enough to recommend I Tonya but if the Tabloid Times is something you subscribe I will highly recommend Gus Van Sant's To Die For and Michael Ritchie's made for television The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom."
1,"I, Tonya",8,19 October 2017,The acting and direction were pretty amazing....,"Tonight I went to the opening night film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and it turned out to be ""I, Tonya"". I wasn't particularly thrilled about this, as I really didn't care much about seeing a biopic about Tonya Harding. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it as the film was exceptionally well directed and the acting was occasionally brilliant. In particular, Australian actress Margot Robbie was simply amazing as Hardingturning in the sort of performance that could mean an Oscar nomination. Likewise, Allison Janney was amazing as wellplaying Tonya's incredibly despicable mother. You really have to respect the great job both of them did in the filmas well as Robbie's learning to skate well in order to make this movie.The film is about the life of Tonya Harding.yes, THAT Tonya Hardingthe one who gained infamy for her part in the attack on rival ice skater Nancy Kerrigan back in 1994. My daughter was only a small child at the time of the attack and I told her nothing about Harding because I wanted to see her perspective on the story. Both of us left very impressed. However, I must put in a warning about the film. It is very violent.filled with intense and very realistic domestic violenceamong the most realistic I have ever seen. With my background as a psychotherapist, this churned up a lot of memories for me and the film often had me in tears. If you have been a victim of domestic violence, then I strongly urge you to think twice before you see the pictureor at least see it with someone you love. Seeing Tonya being slugged, slapped and even shot was tough to watch. Interestingly, often the audience responded by laughingan inappropriate but thoroughly understandable coping mechanism for such ugliness.Does the film excuse Harding's behaviors or paint her out to be a victim? Not reallyand if it had, the film would have been a waste of time. What it does do is help you at least understand who she was and why she did what she didas she was more than just an intense competitor who didn't come forward when she learned her husband and his friend had physically assaulted Tonya's competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. Overall, a fascinating look back to one of the most celebrated news stories of the 1990s.one that folks who are old fogies, like me, well remember!"
2,"I, Tonya",8,7 December 2017,"I, Tonya (2017)","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.I, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.The film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.Some wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.7.5/10"
3,"I, Tonya",10,18 September 2017,A triple axel of a skating movie,"If I could have voted online for the best movie that I saw at TIFF 2017 (the voting was limited to iPhone and Android users), it would have been for this film, which wound up second in the People's Choice award competition. Director Craig Gillespie has tackled a difficult subject brilliantly without removing the considerable number of warts from the main characters. This film should garner a considerable number of Oscar nominations, including best picture and director.Margot Robbie should be a lock for a Best Actress nod, completely burying her Australian background to deliver American white trash with complete credibility. (She won't win of course, because ... Tonya.) Her skating sequences are edited brilliantly - you really believe that it's her.THE surest Oscar bet has to be Allison Janney as Tonya's acerbic, domineering, Swisher-chain-smoking mother LaVona Golden. She gives what I call a ""schizophrenia"" performance - there's no way that anyone seeing JUNO and this film back-to-back would ever notice that the mothers in both films are played by the same actress. Robbie got the loudest applause when the actors were introduced before the film, but when they came out afterwards, Janney's applause was equivalent to hers.The story sticks to facts and places most of the blame for the Kerrigan incident on Sean Eckhardt, played with spot-on obnoxiousness by Paul Walter Hauser. The rest goes to hubby-at-times Jeff Gillooly, played by Sebastian Stan. He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.The subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story."
4,"I, Tonya",10,28 December 2017,"More than about tabloid trash, this movie should be watched","Anyone who was old enough to be sucked in by the media circus that this scandal turned into should make it a point to take a look at this film, in my opinion.The media seemed much more about the sensationalism of it all than it was about maintaining the kind of objective balance that'd presume Tonya's innocence until evidence proved otherwise. 
But being honest, even if evidence came along that absolved Harding of any wrongdoing in the Kerrigan attack, how happy would the media have been to report it? Or would we have been to hear it? Because we've got to admit that, although it might not seem very nice, there was quite a bit of fun to be had during the couple months we spent focusing on this Hillbilly girl and her bumbling husband, right? Well with that in mind, what would the thought of her innocence have brought, other than damage to the narrative we were having such fun with? Regardless of where you stand in regards to her innocence, its only fair to acknowledge that her role had been laid out for her pretty much from the get-go. Kerrigan was its hero the moment she became the victim, could we have honestly entertained the notion that maybe Harding wasn't as much the villain as seemed to befit the story? How fun would that have been? Really?In the last couple months, the articles about this upcoming movie had comment sections riddled with people mostly bemoaning the current state of Hollywood. Not the scandals, but that it'd even stoop so low as to peddle this kind of white trash story. ""White trash"" came up repeatedly of course, and while comment sections generally aren't the place to find the best sampling of voices, I personally wasn't able to find a single comment that was anything other than damningly derivative of Hollywood and/or Tonya...certainly not one suggesting the possibility that maybe there was more to this story than what we already knew. But that was always a possibility, wasn't it? The telling of a side that we hadn't heard?After seeing the flick last night, I passed along my recommendation of it to a friend, commenting that Tonya Harding's guilt might have to be re-thought. In response, I got a chuckling, ""Oh I have a hard time believing that!"" Which, sure that has to be the prevailing opinion, I'd imagine. 
But why? Do we really and truly think that we have the kind of information on the subject that'd allow for the most objective, fact-based decision on it? Have many of us ever stopped long enough to have wondered whether or not we did? The line of questioning isn't likely to be met with much more than scoffs by those who've yet to view the movie, but they're questions that end up being well begged and something that the same people may find themselves unwittingly exploring afterward. I sure have been.In the meantime, this isn't just a great movie, but a great sports movie, detailing an ice skating prodigy who love for skating drove her life, and whose life ultimately served as a testament to just how influential a class system can be that many of us are barely cognizant of even existing. 
Based off interviews and testimony from the key players in the Kerrigan scandal, watching it brings a much needed sense of balance to the story and will likely leave you amazed at how easily the truth can be blurred when viewed through the lens of sensationalized media coverage. 10/10, great movie that grabs you from its opening scene and will have you entranced throughout."
5,"I, Tonya",6,11 December 2017,Allison Janney Steals The Show In This Wild Biopic!,"Before I give my thoughts on 'I, Tonya', let me just say two words: Allison Janney. The Multiple Time Emmy-Winning Actress delivers one of the STRONGEST Performances of the year, in her portrayal of LaVona Fay Golden, Tonya Harding's Mother from hell. Janney is pure Oscar-GOLD.And now coming to the film...'I, Tonya' like any other sports Biopic, shows us a woman from being a bullied nobody to becoming a somebody in the world of sports. Over-here, we explore Tonya Harding's hardened journey, that is at times powerful & at times exhausting.'I, Tonya' Synopsis: Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie, in great form) rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband (Sebastian Stan, very good) intervenes.'I, Tonya' is about Tonya's violent journey, that started from an impossible, no-holds-barred mother to a violent, brutal husband, who eventually ruined her career. But, Tonya is not a victim of her circumstances. Here is a woman, who despite being thrown into a world of ice-skating & rigorous competition, left a strong mark. She may have not done the right things to get to the position she got, but she was a talented personality who had the power to mesmerize & inspire.Steven Rogers' Screenplay begins superbly & the personal interviews of its characters throughout the film, give it that extra edge. The first-hour is solid & gets into Tonya's world & the people involved with a wicked sense of humor. The second-hour is a little disappointing & overlong, and the sub-plot involving the 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's rival and Olympic teammate, offers less impact. The Writing isn't always compelling & takes away some glory from the film, overall. The Dialogue, however, are crackling & foul to the core.Craig Gillespie's Direction captures all the madness & ambition, with skill. The Director is in good form this time around. Nicolas Karakatsanis's Cinematography & Tatiana S. Riegel's Editing are strongly done. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention.Performance-Wise: Janney is outstanding & is sure to pick up many awards for her portrayal here. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the Oscar home, next year! Margot Robbie, also is in very form, delivering a credible turn as Tonya. Sebastian Stan is entirely convincing as the violent husband. And Paul Walter Hauser is terrific as Shawn, one of Stan's friends, who leads Tonya & Stan, into much trouble.On the whole, 'I, Tonya' is an imperfect biopic about an imperfect woman. Do watch it though, especially for Janney's sterling performance."
6,"I, Tonya",8,2 January 2018,Relevant movie,"Why relevant? Until I saw this movie, in my point of view Tonya Harding was a cheat and a lowlife and this was entirely based on the media coverage of the events in 1994. Having seen the movie I feel ashamed about how easily I judged her and I realised I have to be way more careful in forming my opinion about people."
7,"I, Tonya",5,17 November 2017,"Janney shines as ""mother from hell"" but Robbie as ""trailer trash"" skating champ is all wrong for the part","I, Tonya, is director Craig Gillespie's take on the mercurial rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the figure skating champion who threw away her career through her association with an abusive ex-husband. Gillespie tells Harding's story through a series of interviews with the principals, most made up to appear how they might look in the present time, speaking directly to the camera, and insisting that their version of events is the correct one.The real star of the film is not the actress who plays Tonya (Margot Robbie) but Allison Janney, who steals the show as Tonya's mother from hell, LaVona Golden, a serial psychological abuser, who still manages to garner sympathy through her abrasively witty comments directed toward Tonya throughout her childhood and into adulthood (as well as directed toward us, the enraptured audience). One can't help sense that LaVona heaped abuse on her daughter both out of love and jealousy-love in the sense that she wanted Tonya to be more successful in life than she was (LaVona being a waitress at a greasy spoon) and jealous once Tonya had achieved the fame and recognition that eluded her mother who was nonetheless a highly intelligent woman. If it wasn't for Janney, I, Tonya, might have been a complete flop, as Robbie, the Australian actress who plays Tonya, is all wrong for the part. This is especially true when Robbie plays Tonya as a teenager-she simply looks too old to be believable. What's worse is how Robbie is unable to convey Tonya's likable qualities-that odd mixture of naivety and ""trailer trash"" aggression that initially endeared the public to her. Instead, Robbie comes off as too harsh, compromising her attempts to convey Tonya's more vulnerable side. While Robbie is an accomplished skater (and this is probably the reason why she was cast), I think it was a big mistake for Gillespie to use her for that reason. Without a compelling protagonist, the necessary verisimilitude is lost.Gillespie's approach, akin to the Japanese classic, Rashomon, works best when Tonya's and husband Jeff Gillooly's differing points of view are contrasted in high relief. Gillooly denied that he ever physically assaulted Tonya but that seems highly unlikely as Tonya's description of what happened has the ring of truth. At a certain point, Tonya had enough of the abuse and decided to walk away from Gillooly-she even had to get a restraining order as he continued to stalk her (once putting a gun to her head, threatening to shoot her). But why did Tonya feel that she needed to go back to Gillooly after separating?-even though she claimed it was only a temporary arrangement. Despite being on the verge of complete success in the skating world, the old demons reared their ugly head-her crushing insecurities from her mother's put-downs and lack of a father figure-this led to her inevitable fall from grace.The bizarre plot to injure Tonya's rival, Nancy Kerrigan concocted by Gillooly's moronic pal, Sean Eckhardt, is so ludicrous that it's hard to believe that he actually thought he could pull something like this off undetected. I happen to believe both Gillooly and Harding's assertions that they were unaware that the plot was going to turn into a physical attack on Kerrigan. Gillooly insisted the initial plan was to send Kerrigan some threatening letters which might perhaps cause her to withdraw from the tournament or throw her off her game. It makes sense that Gillooly would confront Eckhardt over his lame-brain decision to have one of his confederates actually break Kerrigan's knee cap with a baton, suggesting that Gillooly had no idea what Eckhardt was ultimately up to.Much of what happens after the attack on Kerrigan, is anti-climactic. Gillespie basically presents a basic recap as to what happened as the story reaches its not so fitful conclusion. Of interest of course are the courtroom machinations, particularly Tonya's decision to take a plea bargain and accept a lifetime ban from figure skating. Benjamin Lee, writing in the Guardian, sums it up perfectly when he writes: ""The zippy fun of the first half dissipates once we reach the overly familiar scenes of the second, the focus on the harebrained criminal scheme feeling particularly sub-Coenesque. It's hardly dull but it's not quite as biting and sharply realized as it could be given the wealth of stranger-than-fiction drama surrounding Harding.""With a more convincing protagonist in the lead role, I, Tonya, might have been a tad bit more enjoyable; nonetheless, there's still Janney's performance to marvel at. And for all those who long for nostalgia, Tonya's story will bring you back to the heady days of the early 1990s, a time that feels way distant from our own."
8,"I, Tonya",8,8 January 2018,"I, Margot","I, Tonya is a movie about Tonya Harding, professional figure skater who became popular because of the rivarly with Nancy Kerrigan and incident that made her charged for. That situation made Tonya one of the most popular people in USA.This movie fulfiled my expectation in terms of biographical segment and learning about this case. Margot Robbie portrayal of Tonya is amazing and we can say this is the best performance so far for Margot. She showed different personalities of the main character from childhood to the final performance in the Olympics 1994. Tonya was so unique and she had specific relationships with two of her biggest support and in the same time stumbling stones in her career, her mother and husband.
Another pleasant suprise is Allison Janey who just won Golden Globe and will be in the Oscar race. Allison plays Tonya Hardings mother LaVona woman with really strange and sometimes harsh behaviour towards her daghter but in some way she pushed her to be good as she was.
Craig Gillespie is director of this movie and he decided to shoot this movie in a little bit cartoonish way but thats what makes this movie funny sometimes. My problem with this movie is that some scenes or should say some situations was repeated so many times in the similar way esspecially towars her relationship with husband Jeff played by Sebastian Stan. 
This movie is divided in two parts, first part refers to getting to know characters and second is about incident and resolving that case. Second part wants to show us how regular people can be stucked in complicated situation similiar to movie Fargo (1996) but this is where that cartoonish shots is the problem because we cant experience that incident and lawsuit seriously and all looks strange in the end but that is risk when you make a movie about famous person and cases of the past.
This movie with all his advantages and disadvantages is decent maybe not what i expected to be but on the other side its not 
disappointment. Margot is the star of this movie and she is big reason why this movie is good and why we will remember Tonya Harding character and personality.
I give this movie 7.7"
9,"I, Tonya",7,24 September 2017,An insider view of Tonya Harding,"Tonya Harding is known in figure skating as the 1st woman to land a Triple Axel in competition, but also for her involvement in the physical attack on fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan. This docu-drama is based on interviews from Tonya, her mother, her coach, and some of the co-conspirators, mixing them with re-creations and some historic footage. It shows the difficulty of a poor kid battling into a sport dominated by upper-middle class princesses. While mostly taking the word of the interviewees, the director inserts hints that Tonya may not be as innocent as she claims. There is also an interesting undermining of Tonya's complaint about Nancy being despondent about winning silver at the 1994 Olympics - listen for the placing announcements before the final skate.This film is 1st runner-up for the People's Choice Awards at the Toronto International Film Festival. However, for me it was marred by the use of music with lyrics at her 1st skating competition, something that would not have been allowed. On the flip side, I can accept the switch in music after she succeeds in her historic Triple Axel, as a switch from skating music to internal emotion."
10,"I, Tonya",10,18 December 2017,The Best Film of the Year,"First, I'm stating that it's the best film of the year, and I just barely care about women's figure skating. So you know that it's phenomenal. For me, it edges out ""Dunkirk,"" which was my favorite 2017 film until the night I saw it. Director Craig Gillespie is obviously a Scorsese protégé, and unlike Martin McDonagh's cheap ripoff of the Cohen brothers, he manages to pay homage to the man without imitating him. Like Scorsese (and Bob Fosse) he meshes documentary with realistic drama seamlessly well.Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan deliver good performances. Allison Janney and especially Paul Walter Hauser deliver OUTSTANDING performances. In fact, I didn't feel like Hauser was even acting as much as he was just BEING. These performances are also a credit to Gillespie.Almost every scene is well-paced, has little ""fat,"" conveys meaning and adds to the narrative, which indicates great video editing. The editing was so good that I didn't even check the time, which is rare for me. Outstanding pacing.When I entered the theater, I didn't think that I was going to get even slightly emotional about Tonya Harding's story. But she is truly a sympathetic character without feeling sorry for herself, which is rare nowadays. Nowadays, everyone seems to be competing for who has it worst and who is the most pathetic victim. In Tonya's world, it's just her life, and it's presented as factual rather than maudlin and soap operatic. As Tonya basically says at the end of the film, ""s--t happens. Deal with it."""
11,"I, Tonya",7,5 January 2018,Glib Retelling of a Sensational Story,"I remember well the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story (I was just graduating from high school when it all went down), and I was very intrigued to see how a movie would portray it all. At the time, I mostly just remember being done with the whole thing by the time it had played itself out. I was so sick of everybody involved, Kerrigan included, and it all just seemed so sleazy and embarrassingly American. The movie made me feel much the same way. These were trashy people living a trashy life style doing trashy things, and despite the film's clear intention to do so, it isn't able to wring much moral significance from the whole episode.Margot Robbie does a fine job in the lead role, avoiding the temptation to do a simple impersonation and instead trying her hardest to turn Tonya Harding into a three-dimensional character. The film limits her success, however, because of its dogged determination to remain glib and cartoonish and play the whole thing like a big joke that the audience is in on. This is weirdly at odds with choices the director, Craig Gillespie, makes at various points in the movie, like giving Tonya monologues about how she's a different person than the media would have us believe, or one uncomfortable scene during which Robbie addresses the movie audience directly and tells us that we collectively are as responsible for persecuting Harding as her abusive husband or monstrous mother. If handled differently, moments like these could have made this film a reflexive examination of America's unhealthy relationship with the media and its obsession with fame, however earned. But the movie is too eager to be a crowd pleaser to dwell for long on anything too serious, so it rushes on to its next bit of comedy and ends up doing to Tonya Harding exactly what it accuses its audience of. In addition to Robbie, Allison Janney is getting a heap of acclaim for her performance as Harding's mother, an absolute horror of a woman. She hits the marks she's asked to hit, but it's a shame that such a talented actress as Janney isn't given more to work with than the gross caricature she's given here. On the other hand, Sebastian Stan, as Tonya's buffoon of an on-again-off-again husband, gives a great performance that no one seems to be talking about.""I, Tonya"" is entertaining, but it doesn't deserve to be remembered in the same company as some of the best films of 2017.Grade: B+"
12,"I, Tonya",6,26 December 2017,"This is a movie about a bidimensional, white trash ice skater - not Tonya Harding.","I finally have watched this movie and I can say I am deeply disappointed. I, as a big fan of figure ice skating was really thrilled about this movie and expected much more. If you don't know much about Tonya Harding's story, I suggest you read about her and watch some of her old and new interviews and you'll understand why I didn't like the movie. One of the reasons is its screen script. There is no ""official story"" about what happened to Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan. The script was written based on interviews with Tonya and her ex-husband, carried on by the screen writer himself. So, much of what is told in the movie is purely fictional, especially the parts about her mother, since she never agreed to talk to the screen writer or the production staff. Tonya herself said some parts of the movie were inaccurate, and Margot Robbie said that when she first read the script she thought it was about a fictional figure skater, not Tonya Harding. Besides, many things in this movie remain unexplained. The movie is basically about the verbal, physical and moral abuse Tonya endured throughout her life, but shows too little how Tonya built her athletic and ice skating career. And regarding the Nancy Kerrigan controversy, there isn't much talked about, either. Nancy is just a shadow in this movie, there's nothing about her point of view or how the incident actually affected her or her career. In the end you feel that you don't really know what the life of Tonya Harding the ice skater was really like.Regarding the direction, I found really tasteless Gillespie's attempt to give a comical tone in the NUMEROUS domestic violence scenes of the movie. The characters break the 4th wall to give the violent scenes a more 'casual' look (because according to Gillespie, Tonya talks about her violent past in a very casual manner), but cinematographically this 'casual tone' didn't work - it only makes it look like the movie romanticizes abuse and underestimates its impact on a woman's life. Also, the whole sarcastic/comical tone of the movie made it feel superficial, boring and childish. To me, a more serious approach to Tonya's life would be more appropriate. And regarding Margot Robbie's performance, I found it very disappointing and amateurish. Regardless the fact that she's not as bulky or athletic as the real Tonya, she played a white trash, foul-mouthed Tonya Harding that never existed. Her interpretation of a redneck is purely stereotypical. Also, I don't know where Robbie's accent came from, since real-life Tonya doesn't have that strong southern accent - she's from Portland, come on! It's an annoying accent that appears and disappears throughout the movie, alongside with the numerous bad words (some of them included by Robbie herself) and a very artificial, rude way to talk that Harding didn't have. Robbie didn't convince me and made me feel NOTHING for her character. On the other side, Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Tonya's mother. She could flawless play a sociopath, and truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination as a supporting actress. Another good surprise in this movie is Paul Walter Hauser's acting. To sum it all up, this is a mediocre movie, that didn't entertain me (how am I supposed to find funny a story with so much domestic violence?), and didn't move me. It also barely tells who in fact Tonya Harding was. It is a superficial, bidimensional portrait of a woman who's surely much more complex than what was shown in the movie."
13,"I, Tonya",10,12 January 2018,Best movie in a few years,This is an amazing black comedy/drama that sheds a very factual account of the tragic life of Tonya Harding. Margo Robbie deserves an Oscar for her perfect portrayal of Miss Harding and the life of abuse she encountered. Several Academy Awards will be won from this movie possibly best actress. Don't hesitate to spend $12.00 to see this piece or art!
14,"I, Tonya",9,8 January 2018,Extremely Involving Movie That Tells a Crazy but True Story With Equal Parts Tragedy and Comedy,"I wasn't old enough to process Tonya Harding's story when it was going on, so I can only describe this movie as a fresh face. I loved how this movie played into the wild and varied accounts about Tonya's life. Instead of presenting one version and calling it ""the truth"" (which Harding even talks about through voice over in the final scene), they present different accounts through Harding (played by Margot Robbie), Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the movie is very ambiguous about what happened. This was refreshing, the story is just so bizarre no matter whose account you choose to believe. It allows the creative team the freedom to cherry-pick what they want to show, and I was constantly engaged. Normally I'm critical when the stray from the facts in a biopic but no one will ever ""actually"" know what happened, so the movie has some fun with it without straying into implausibility.So, knowing that the movie toys with the story a little, I still was floored by the characters and the character development. Tonya Harding, whether she was guilty or not, became a sympathetic in my eyes. I'm not saying that what she did was right or that Kerrigan deserved it (that shouldn't even be a question) but with the kind of upbringing she had, was she going to be an emotionally stable adult? I would say no. Even though the world decided she was the villain, her work ethic and her perseverance made her endearing to me. Gillooly and Golden are villains and they're monsters but the movie makes them characters that you want to follow. Add in one of the dumbest characters I've seen on screen in Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser) and a surprisingly informative narrator in Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) and you have a movie populated by unforgettable characters that all have a surprising amount of depth.I've talked about the characters and how closely the movie sticks to the facts, but I wanted to add how sharp of a script I think this was. The movie is hilarious at points and it just breaks your heart at others. The dialogue is always sharp (even though its vulgar as h@!!) and I found the movie suspenseful throughout. They also present serious issues like spousal/familial abuse in a different light. Tonya faces violence daily and instead of stopping the movie to show it, its very much treated as an everyday occurrence. It is shocking and every time you're starting to have too much fun, it just sobers you up completely. It was a bold but effective choice to show how screwed up her life was. Add in the great 4th wall breaking and narration from different characters, they really produced something special with this.The script was great, but Gillespie and his team shot the crap out of this too. The skating and action scenes are dynamic with the camera constantly moving and showing things from different angles. What Tonya and the other skaters do as athletes is an art and the movie shows that. I also thought the movie was gritty but had a sense of style. There's also a neat shot showing the passage of time after one of Tony and Jeff's breakups that weaves things together beautifully. Instead of just skating by, the movie committed to making things exciting from a visual standpoint.I, Tonya has also garnered some deserved praise for the actors and actresses. Even as a fan, I was blown away by Margot Robbie as Tonya. She doesn't look like Harding, but her performance has so much emotion and effort in it that she capably carries this movie. She's probably going to get an Oscar nomination for this and she deserves it. She's got tons of talent and I hope she gets more roles like this. I was expecting great things from Robbie, but the surprising performance was Sebastian Stan as Jeff. He really did great work, he's the underrated one in this cast. He capably plays Jeff as a slimy/bad guy but complex nonetheless. Allison Janney is just evil as LaVona and she's also deserving of the praise/award recognition for her work. She's so awful but you can't turn away because of Janney's performance. Paul Walter Hauser is perfect in the worst way for Shawn. He's so stupid and Hauser plays up the idiocy of the character so well. I also liked Bobby Cannavale in his small role, he's a nice mix of sleazy and funny that helps round out the story.I only have 1 criticism of this movie and its not the one that most of the reviews have. The biggest complaint I've heard about the movie is the CGI in the skating sequences, that its obvious that they've put Margot Robbie's head on another skater. I didn't think it was a seamless effect, but I never had a problem with it. My problem was that they made the decision to have Robbie and Stan play the 15-16 year old versions of Harding and Gillooly and while I get it would have been an awkward transition (by the end of the movie, Harding is only 23 so how else could they have done it?) I still found it hard to buy them at those points. I don't want to blame the actors, but it just came off as a rare misstep for a largely flawless movie.This is one of 2017's best movies for me. It was highly praised and after seeing it, I think rightly so. I think the acting, direction and script were all impressive and the movie came together to be something worth going to see. I wish it had a bigger release, I had to go out of my way to see this but I, Tonya is a great sports biopic that breaks the mold. Check this out if you get the chance."
15,"I, Tonya",2,30 December 2017,I wanted to like this movie.... but,"I hate when they try to make ""realistic"" bios, i.e. mock documentaries and/or ""interviews"" that are supposed to be real or feel real, but the actors still ""act"" and just aren't believable.And if you are going to play real life people, then get them close to the real people. But here they really just didn't. They played everyone as caricatures. But because they did that, it didn't feel serious and came off as a goofy comedy.And as a side note, the CGI face on the skater of Margot was too noticeable.If Real life Tonya had that life as they portrayed, they should have made it more sympathetic. I just didn't feel for her. Even if the script was workable, which I don't think it was, as I think they should have gone a different direction, the execution was not good, for the reasons stated. Just bad direction. Could also be because they got an Australian to direct a movie about Americans and there is a just a geographical and cultural disconnect that he didn't get. Just watch interviews with Tonya harding and then watch Margot's ""performance"" in the film and you can see it's miles apart and you can do that with every single character in the film. Just so far off, which always bothers me."
16,"I, Tonya",4,28 December 2017,When the description of the movie is not what you get.,"They described the movie ""Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships,"" When in reality it is a story of abuse between deranged people. I was getting ready to watch a sports bio pic... There is no rise amongst the ranks in this film. That story-line is the 17th most important in the story-line after the fact that her idiot husband can't fix a car. 
I gave it a 4 because the cast was good. They are really good in the movie but it is just not a good movie to be in."
17,"I, Tonya",,13 December 2017,Unconventional Bio-Pic,"Director Craig Gillespie's I, TONYA is an unconventional Bio-Pic - so unconventional that the term itself doesn't really apply. Part-Mockumentary, Part-Drama and Part-Dark Satire, TONYA gives us a cracked version of Tonya Harding's life and and the events surrounding the knee-capping of Nancy Kerrigan in the week's leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics. TONYA contains not one, but several, unreliable narrators lead by Tonya herself (Margo Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and Tonya's estranged mom LaVona (Allison Janney). The movie is framed with faux interviews with them (and others) - often speaking straight to the camera (a convention which also occurs within scenes in the movie). But, make no mistake, Gillespie and Screenwriter Steve Rogers very much favor Tonya's POV here. It's her slant on the story that takes center ice. The movie works as well as it does because of the cast and the lure of the lurid true story. Robbie looks nothing like Harding despite hours of makeup (this is made clear when we see clips of the real Harding), but, she enthusiastically takes on the role, giving it a grit and energy that keeps the movie on balance despite some significant bumps along the way. Stan and Paul Walter Hauser (as Gilooly's henchman Shawn Eckhardt) are also fine. More problematic is Janney's LaVona. Janney is a superb actress, but, here she is so over the top that she verges on being a cartoon (unsurprisingly, the real LaVona Golden wasn't interviewed by the filmmakers, so it is little wonder than she comes off the worst of the major characters).  The contrivance of an unreliable narrator isn't a bad concept, but, too often I, TONYA ends up feeling unreliable itself. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) is very much shunted to the background (and only utters one word, ""Why!??""). To believe I, TONYA you'd think that Kerrigan was some rich Ice Queen in contast to the working class Harding. The truth is that Kerrigan's family was also working class (the Dad working three jobs to pay for her training). It's understood that the movie is from Harding's perspective, but, at a certain point, you have to wonder about the movie's overall authenticity. Matters aren't helped by a certain reluctance on the part of the filmmakers to have dramatic scenes play out. There is some very nasty physical and sexual abuse on display, but, they are often undercut with a wink, a retro song (often not very good selections) or a quip directly at the camera. It's as if the filmmakers are saying to the viewer, ""Yes, some bad stuff happened, but, hey, here's a funny aside - you're still having fun and enjoying the movie, ain't ya?!"" And, some of the mugging for the camera makes it seem like the cast is auditioning for an off-Broadway production of an early Coen Brothers film. Despite some major qualms, I, TONYA refreshingly breaks the mold of a Bio-Pic. It's simply too bad that the filmmakers couldn't find a consistent and more thoughtful tone."
18,"I, Tonya",3,31 December 2017,Make up your mind! What kind of movie are you making?,"What kind of movie was this supposed to be? Because it bounced back and forth between dead-on realism (Rawlinson) and raw violence (domestic and parental) to satire? (Harding's interview recreations) and absurdist comedy (Eckardt - good lord!) to the point where I just didn't know what the filmmaker(s) were trying to accomplish. I learned nothing new about Harding's story here, so maybe my POV on the story was the target? If so, you need to pick a tone and stick to it. Because I felt continually jerked around, I came out of this movie within antagonism toward the whole enterprise and sympathy for none.And as for the acting, I personally thought Robbie was terribly miscast as Harding---didn't believe her for a moment, and Janney, while competent and entertaining, can play this type of supporting role in her sleep and did nothing here to convince me otherwise.I just ended up feeling that maybe this movie was better suited for the Lifetime TV channel--although even there a couple of reality TV documentaries have told the same story in a more interesting manner."
19,"I, Tonya",2,3 January 2018,Disgusting!,"No SpoilersConsidering the level of involvement Tonya Harding herself had in the attack, it is disgusting and irresponsible that she is being portrayed as a victim here!!Granted, back in 1994 she played dumb and acted like she didn't know anything about the attack. However, over 2 years ago new evidence came to light that proves she was heavily involved in the planning of the attack from the get-go!The fact that this movie tries to paint her as a victim is a gross misrepresentation of the facts! She was a conniving, manipulative, sore loser that exhibited the epitome of poor sportsmanship! Karma lucked her butt; and doesn't deserve our sympathy, nor any income from this movie!"
20,"I, Tonya",1,15 December 2017,A condescending & contrived take on Harding,"I, Tonya is a *mockumentary* of Harding life & it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Should we start glamorizing & showing empathy to every criminal (regardless of their upbringing)? Is it appropriate to *mock* domestic violence and poor people in a condescending fashion? These are the questions I found myself asking after watching ''I, Tonya?'' Janney as LaVona steals the show as Harding's abusive & vulgar mother. She completely overshadows Robbie, who I felt was miscast even though she produced. Apart from the costume & scruffy hair, her transformation wasn't overly noticeable. I was seeing Robbie, not Harding."
21,"I, Tonya",10,15 January 2018,Not an monster...,"""I, Tonya"" is amazing. Margot Robbie gifts a career defining performance. Margot plays disgraced 1994 US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance as Tonya is fearless, vulnerable, sad and poignantly flawed. Harding is notorious for knowing about the attack upon US figure skating Champion Nancy Kerrigan which led to her eventual ban from competitive skating which was her life. Director Craig Gillespie neither vilifies nor justifies Tonya offering the experience of being her. That she wanted to be was loved, to be gotten, and to be the best. At the time Tonya was the only women's figure skater in the world to land the impossible triple axel in competition. Robbie as Tonya in an interview in the movie acknowledged when she landed the triple axel in the trials she knew, ""I was the best!"" Tonya was driven, the figure skating phenom, but she was less than phenom in her life. I think that is the poignancy of Gillespie's direction and Steven Rogers's story. ""I, Tonya"" is not really dark comedy. ""I, Tonya"" is just dark with laughs in its irony and the stupidity of those closest to Tonya. The movie is the dichotomy that defines the tragedy of domestic violence and abuse. In one scene Tonya's husband Jeff, played by convincing Sebastian Stan, slams the freezer door in Tonya's face, because she questions why he didn't buy Dove ice cream bars. That is so wrong. That makes you so angry. Gillespie depicts that pattern of abuse throughout of beating on screen. And Tonya takes it, and stays until she can no longer. The abuse originates with Mom LaVona, played by focused Allison Janney, who thinks she is tough love as she pushes her daughter in her skating career. No, Mom is an abuser. Janney's LaVona could have been comic caricature; instead she brilliantly nuances the single Mom working waitress raising her kid the way she was raised. Robbie is touching humanity as Tonya, who has the self awareness that she is uneducated, but she is smarter than she thinks and way smarter than those surrounding her. ""I, Tonya"" and Robbie in contrasts of edgy humor and human cruelty touchingly tells the story of how we are raised and the people we choose to spend life with either define or curse. Much about Tonya seems to be the in order to, to prove something. In the great scene before her competition her new Coach Doty, played by strong Bojana Novakovic, tells her ""You show them."" That I think becomes the conversation that dominates Tonya's life. Needing her Mom's help after she leaves husband Jeff, Tonya sees her Mom. She asks her Mom that when she was a kid, ""Did you love me?"" Robbie's Tonya is in tears. That breaks your heart. Really Tonya just wanted to be loved, like we all do. That may be the point of Gillespie's ""I, Tonya"" with all its emotional extremes and uncomfortable laughs. Perhaps, most of the laughs come from the blatant stupidity of Jeff and his idiot friend Shawn, played by good Paul Walter Hauser. Maybe ""I, Tonya"" works in its profound sadness as well. Toward the end Tonya says, ""I am not a monster."" No, she's not. She is just the little girl who wanted to be loved and never got it. She was driven and wanted to be the best. Tonya is just human. She is both lightness and darkness. Perhaps within ""I, Tonya"" are loud laughs and the subtle lesson of having compassion. ""I, Tonya"" is one of my favorite movies of the year."
22,"I, Tonya",5,26 December 2017,i don't know if they should've made that movie..,"Margot robbie definitely gave one of her greatest performances ever, yet the film had a lot of flaws
there is a lot of confusing decisions made in this movie,
the fact that they made the same actors do their teen-aging years and their 20 years later versions was kinda hard to believe
and the way 'the incident"" was delivered was a bit confusing too
in fact, the way the whole story was delivered was not the greatest.the performances was the only thing that made that whole movie bearable really,
Margot Robbie did a great job playing her character and so did Allison Janney, her performance was so convincing i wanted to punch her in the face through out the entire movie
sebastian stan's performance was kind of confusing though.
i mean, he did have some moments that made me so believe him, but other than that i thought his squeaky attempt to impersonate jeff's voice (which turned out not being that squeaky in the real interview) was kinda disturbing, but that is a director's thing though, which brings us back to the wrong decisions the movie in general made me question the reason why they did it, it somehow felt at some point that the producers themselves didn't know the actual truth behind the incident tooafter all, it still had some touching moments and kinda felt enjoyable at some moments, although this feeling doesn't last so long
but it's still a movie telling a story about a girl who stood for her dream but in no ordinary way."
23,"I, Tonya",7,23 December 2017,or as the judges would say: 5.6(?),"I, Tonya is that frustrating good movie that should or could be better. Not much of any fault can be found on the actors, and while they're all quite good it's Robie and Janney's movie (sometimes Stan's too as he effectively shows he can do more outside of Bucky). And the direction is absolutely acceptable as far as how Craig Gillespie moves the camera and knows how to hold on a shot when he must - certainly at an absolutely crucial moment, without music and only Robie's face as she goes back and forth from tears to smiles in a mirror, is that moment - and getting this work with the actors had to take some deep work. No, everything problematic is the script and the music, and it's not so much what is there as what isn't and/or what could have been.I didnt know much at all about the Harding/Kerrigan story outside of the general basics of the ""Incident"" as all of the characters in I, Tonya call it, but as much as I might get out of the repeated abuse that Tonya received as a daughter and a spouse may make her more sympathetic (the connection of her physical, as well as mental, abuse to that she received from the media in 94), but I wondered if they could have shown other things to make the story more complicated. Of course there's the bungled crime plot part of it - maybe this screenwriter is a big Coen fan along with Scorsese, and make no mistake this is down-the-line Diet Scorsese, which ill expound on in a moment - and yet Tonya had, from what the movie tells us, a connection *to Nancy Kerrigan as a friend.*As the audience, what do we get to see with that? Tonya saying it one line and then we see them giggling on a bed. That's it. What is that bond that happened there? Why was Tonya friends with someone who was much more beloved and maybe/maybe not had the hard existence that Tonya had it? I have to think Robie when presented with the script likely responded to the potential in getting deeper into what is underneath when Tonya talks to us (4th wall is broken not only by fake documentary style but by characters doing it mid scene) and is beaten up and fights back and then accepts whats happened and then in reverse the joy of being on the ice. Did she actually respond to the plot mechanics? Because those... I dunno.None of it is actively bad exactly. If you are looking for straight entertainment that goes for an invigorating ""we're fuck ups but we're human beings look beyond the media depictions"" take, that is there. But Gillespie or the producers or whomever missed out on what could have been more... *showing* us Harding's existence instead of flat *telling* us. That is where they try for Scorsese first, as far as showing us a group of unlike able but honestly depicted characters (and among them Tonya is by FAR the easiest to understand, everyone else is a pathetic creeper or abuser or, well, okay Janney is outstanding as always and I will take her total conviction over exact depth), but it falls flat because the narration isn't necessary for that purpose, it's not original enough to stand out. It is just... There. The second part is the music.Just... Please, music supervisors, and I shall assume this had the same hack as Suicide Squad (the Robie connection coincidental. Maybe), listen to some of the deeper cuts on a CD or your iTunes, it is certainly possible to get something else than the same dozen 70s and 80s classic rock tracks to show us ""yes, hard rocking 70s times!"" A shame since I like most of the songs in and of themselves, and could see some value in a couple of them (the ZZ Top track which may/may not have been there when Tonya was skating early on is a good example and a deeper track that fits the scene). But like the script the songs spell things out to nearly comic degrees; Janney's mother has 4 year old Tonya on the ice, how about ""Devil Woman""? Theres another drive away ""for good"" from a mega blowout fight between Robie and Stan? How about ""Goodbye Stranger"" by Supertramp? It eventually is overkill too, but the bigger problem is that it accents the scenes and doesnt do scenes dramatic service. It tells us how to feel before we can get a handle or trust what's already there.I know this sounds like a dumping on on all of I, Tonya, but that may be in part an expectations thing. I thought if it was going to Goodfellas or maybe Wolf of Wall st lengths it might take a satirical view on this uncanny sports saga - the trailer leads one on that direction too, a great trailer I should add - but it is more like an inverted Raging Bull. What if we got the woman's take on being in seemingly endless cycles of abuse, and you cant take what happens off the ice on it either (except maybe to uh prove the abusers wrong?) and yet it is .... not that kind of story either because we do get a lot more of an indication of where the abuse comes from. It's an experience where I absolutely adore everything the actors are doing, I could go on and on about how much Robie owns even (especially even) the smaller scenes that need to be quieter like with Julianne Nicholson (unrecognizable as always), and at the same time they had richer material and a less hackneyed attitude to certain parts of the style.Oh, and last thing that may be a nitpick, but... It is really distracting at times how obvious it isn't Robie's face on the body during some of the skating moves. Just get a good double people! Dont make me get the club on you VFX slackers!"
24,"I, Tonya",8,16 January 2018,"I, Tonya Review","I, Tonya is a film directed by Craig Gillespie. I hadn't known about this film until, I heard about the Golden Globe nominations. This film also got some rave reviews, which increased my curiosity for the film. So I finally decided to give it a watch without watching any trailers. And I can say that I wasn't disappointed.Plot: The life and times of Tonya Harding, a professional ice skater and the 1994 controversy that led to her subsequent downfall.Story and direction: This film is not your conventional biopic. The makers decided a different way to go about it, which works quite a lot in the film. It employs the fourth wall breaking and mockumentary technique, which fascinated me a lot. The characters also are varied and interesting. We have Tonya who from her childhood itself was hardened to become strong and stand for herself. Then is LaVona, Tonya's mother, who is very hard on her and wants to make her daughter stand on her own and fight for herself. We also have Jeff, Tonya's husband, who has various shades for his character. And finally, Shawn, Jeff's friend, who is that dumb person everyone has in their life. The skating shots also looked very real. It never felt that a stunt double was doing the skating and it was edited so beautifully to make it look like one shot. The selection of music is great too. I felt like dancing in each of the soft rock numbers that played on screen. But this film has some issues that bug me. For instance, towards the last act the film felt quite rushed. And also some characters were just kind of not given that screen space which should have been done. Performances: Margot Robbie did it again. She never failed to impress. From sad to happy she yet again proves how fine an actress she is. Sebastian Stan was also great. I didn't expect this kind of a performance out of him. Allison Janney just killed it. The way she adapted to LaVona Harding was awesome. She just mesmerized me. Bobby Cannavale was restricted to only the interview parts of the film, but still it's always fun to watch him. Favorite Scene: The scene where LaVona warns Tonya about Jeff right after Tonya's wedding. We see a mother's worry and a daughter just not caring about what the mother thinks of her choice. This is the kind of scene that takes place between every mother and daughter even now, which touched me a lot.Verdict: Although there are a few hiccups, I, Tonya doesn't have a single dull moment. I liked the not-so conventional take on a biopic. Do watch this film for some awesome performances and the great soundtrack.I am going with an 8/10."
25,"I, Tonya",7,15 January 2018,"Supporting characters shine, Robbie not so much.","Can this be called a documentary? A mockumentary? Biopic? At different times throughout the film it felt like it wanted to be any one of all three of these. Still after ending credits rolled, the film didn't stick with me. It was good, and for a handful of scenes very good.
 However it was never great. Margot Robbie was the wrong actress for this, with an especially wrong accent. Tonya Harding is not an Eastcoaster, she's from Oregon. Robbie is an average actress at best. Should have been Amy Adams all the way! On the other hand Allison Janney did a great job, and even more so Sebastian Stan as Harding's abusive husband. This is one of the few movies I believe could have benefited from an additional 15 to 20 minutes of runtime. At 2 hrs runtime that should be enough to forge a strong connection between characters and audience, but that connection never fully developed for me. Less editing may have helped. Different editing choices also. Perhaps more in depth coverage of Harding's childhood and adolescence, and less coverage of every single time she got beat by her husband. All in all its solid, but not outstanding. With a stronger lead character and different pacing I would have given it a 7.5/10. As it stands now my rating is 6.5/10."
26,"I, Tonya",7,15 January 2018,Interesting,"Everyone has been raving about this movie, so I had to go see it for my self. Now that I have seen it I honestly don't have much to say about it.This movie was interesting to watch, it was also educational because I was not familiar with the events that took place since I was young and living in a different country. ""I,Tonya"" doesn't really break any new grounds in filmmaking but it's a complete, enjoyable, entertaining and (for the most part) real story.The only thing that particularly stands out in this movie is Margot Robbie's absolutely INCREDIBLE performance as Tonya Harding. I think without her this movie couldn't exist or would fall under every radar. I really liked the style and the seamless blending of genres as well as the fourth wall breaking, it made it more unique.If you need to kill some time or you like movies about real people, this is a good choice. Definitely not the kind of movie you have to see on release in theatres, I'd say wait a few months and watch it in the comfort of your own home.7.5/10"
27,"I, Tonya",7,15 January 2018,a compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good,"From its confessional title to inconclusive finale, I, Tonya (2017) is the kind of film that leaves you wondering why it was made. The fragmented mockumentary approach disguises a lightweight narrative filled mostly with deplorable people with few redeeming qualities. However, Margot Robbie's compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good turns an otherwise lacklustre melodrama into an engaging performance.The pathologically unfiltered stage-mother LaVona Fay Golden (Allison Janney) was the kind of mother than nobody deserved. She forced her four-year daughter into ice skates and a life of verbal and physical abuse. Without ever once enjoying a mother's praise, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up a talented competitive figure skater who had nothing else in her life except Olympic dreams. To escape her mother, she fell in with another abuser Jeff Gillooley (Sebastian Stan) who became her husband. Despite the elite skating fraternity looking down on Tonya for her loud-mouthed brashness and being too poor to buy costumes, she competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics to win a fourth place. Retiring briefly, she mounted a comeback while her husband and his moronic friends arranged an inept attack on Tonya's main skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. She recovered quickly yet the entire story leads to the question: what was Tonya's role in the attack?It is difficult to label this film: it is not a serious whodunit nor is it funny enough to call it a black comedy. The mockumentary technique leans heavily towards telling rather than showing and the narrative is disrupted constantly by actors shifting out of character and into the role of interviewee. But the effect of multiple narrators is to construct a swirling matrix of viewpoints, in the middle of which Tonya desperately struggles to find respect and belonging. Margot Robbie's performance is outstanding. To convincingly play a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was force-fed elite skating despite abuse from her mother, husband, sporting judges, and the media, is no small achievement. Whether the film makes a compelling case that we should care at all is another matter. With Tonya centre stage, the camera treads lightly over her abusers and leaves us guessing about her involvement in the Kerrigan attack.If you are hoping to see some skating excitement the film will disappoint. There is a noticeable absence of narrative tension in either the characters or depicted events, yet the story engages our sympathy for Tonya. Themes like the discriminatory politics of elite sport and the social burdens of class and family dysfunction get a light airing, but it's hard to see this as a message film. Those who remember the real Tonya and the attack will find it interesting. For others, the unusual story format and characterisations are more enough to hold your attention."
28,"I, Tonya",,15 January 2018,No sympathy for Harding.,"This movie tries to excuse Harding's conduct by portraying her (miserable) mother and former husband as cruel and abusive but Harding made no effort to improve the quality of her life.
But does that excuse Harding's classless, disrespectful, abusive personalty? No way.
The acting is good, and the production fine.
The movie attempts to encourage sympathy for Harding but its difficult to believe she wasnt involved in or at least know of the attack on Kerrigan. Clearly her mother, if portrayed accurately, is one of the meanest, evil people one could ever meet.
Overall, I would recommend this movie only to get the historical background but be skeptical about how Harding and Gilhooley are shown. It seems they are more culpable in real life than the movie suggests.
The cigarette product placement is annoying and insulting and if big tobacco paid to finance this film, it should be made public and investigated."
29,"I, Tonya",8,14 January 2018,A Bunch of Entertaining Gillooly,"It's often difficult to find the balance of portraying real life events accurately and delicately. And I say delicately because there's so many times when movies take the approach of brushing over real life events with a cheap and safe version of what actually happened. Vague, but true. However, I, Tonya throws all of that out the window by telling a fascinatingly outrageous story of Tonya Harding's upbringing, triumph, and of course the downfall following the Nancy Kerrigan attack.
The attack may be what you go to see the movie for, but it's far from the centerpiece of this ridiculously ridiculous film. And yes, I just said that. I, Tonya has irreverent humor with an underlying sense of heart (which I didn't expect), and oh it's also filled with the most vacuous of characters/real humans. You will walk out of the theater asking yourself, ""did all of this really happen?"", and the most likely answer is yes.
Director Craig Gillespie, who has done films like The Finest Hours and Million Dollar Arm stepped into unchartered territory with I, Tonya, and did so rather well. Whether it be fourth-wall breaking, heightening scenes to improve the effect, or even shooting visceral ice skating sequences, the energy of this film never stops.
Gillespie isn't the only hero of this movie, as it's hard to overlook the performances of Margot Robbie and Allison Janney as Tonya and her mother respectively. Producing as well, Robbie is clearly devoted to this role and it sure looks like she'll get some gold this awards season because of it. Her counterpart, Janney, may do exactly the same, as a scene stealer and brutally relentless mother. If I were a betting man, I may put my money that those two to win this Oscar's. So a wild story, told in an insanely entertaining way, makes for one enjoyable 120 minutes.
8.3/10"
30,"I, Tonya",10,14 January 2018,"Funny, Heartbreaking, Revelatory","Do you want to be shocked? Here goes: ""I, Tonya"" is a great movie. That's right. A film about a tabloid scandal in the world of women's figure skating is not just a good movie, it's a great one. I cannot think of any other film that made me laugh out loud and cry so hard, and to do both at once, in reaction to the same scene. ""I, Tonya"" is as frightening and heartbreaking a depiction of child abuse as I have ever seen. It is as profound a meditation on class. Its depiction of ""white trash, redneck, trailer trash"" loves, lifestyles, dreams, delusions, smeared kitchens, underdone bedrooms, and dimly-lit living rooms ripped my heart right out of my chest. If you love movies and you care about social class in America, and how the 24/7 news cycle brainwashes gullible audiences and destroys lives, you owe it to yourself to see ""I, Tonya."" Allison Janney just won the Golden Globe for her portrayal of LaVona Fay ""Sandy"" Golden, Tonya Harding's mother. Janney's performance is one of the most powerful performances I have ever seen in any movie. When Janney is onscreen, you can't take your eyes off her. There is something very compelling about a mother who abuses her own daughter. You want to understand. You want to find the mechanism that runs this monster. You search for some sign of humanity, of redemption, of love. Though ""I, Tonya,"" is sometimes a campy movie, Janney is never campy. She is a force of nature, like a scorpion or Bubonic plague. There is a scene in ""I, Tonya,"" where Tonya's mother performs an act of betrayal of her daughter so severe that it took my breath away. This betrayal, the real Tonya Harding says, took place in real life. What a lousy ""mother."" There is a special hatred for white trash in America. This hatred has no easy name like ""racism."" We all know that racism is evil, but Americans are always eager to mock and denigrate working-class whites, especially poor white women. The 24/7 tabloid news cycle bashed Tonya Harding far harder, and for far longer, than Gillooly's goons bashed Nancy Kerrigan's knee. Tabloids told gullible audiences too lazy to think for themselves that Tonya Harding herself planned the attack. The legal record, and the film ""I, Tonya,"" tell a different story. Teenaged Tonya married the first man she dated. He beat her, as did her mom. It was he, and his delusional friend Shawn Eckhardt, court records say, who orchestrated the attack on Kerrigan. Tonya learned of this after the attack and did not turn him in. She was punished for that. Though she had no means of earning a livelihood outside of skating, she was forced out of skating for life. In fact, the world of women's figure skating never much liked Tonya Harding. She was a superior athletic skater, but she wasn't pretty, patrician and ethereal as the judges preferred. Tonya Harding has been screwed over by many for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons. I'm glad she has this film to tell another side to her story. ""I, Tonya"" does not whitewash or glamorize her. She is shown fighting and breaking up with Gillooly, and then going back to this man she knows is bad for her. Tonya is foul-mouthed and she gets angry at judges who cheat her on scores. She sabotages her own training by drinking, smoking, and partying. Margot Robbie is terrific. She does almost all of her own skating, after months of training. The had to CGI the triple axel, because only Tonya Harding, and a handful of other women, could do that. ""I, Tonya""'s depiction of Jeff Gillooly and his bizarre goons is both hysterically funny and dreadful. Sebastian Stan plays Gillooly. Though he is repeatedly shown beating Tonya, I never lost sympathy for him. I loathed him as a loser, but I could see his skewed humanity. He acknowledges, with regret, destroying his wife's exceptional skating career. The real Jeff Gillooly acknowledged the same thing, and also expressed regret. Shawn Eckhardt, who was happy to identify himself as the attack mastermind, may have been mentally ill. In an interview with Diane Sawyer, he claimed to be a terrorism expert. In fact, he was a loser who lived at home with his parents. He died young. Both Jeff Gillooly and Shawn Eckhardt changed their names after the attack. Gillooly, now Jeff Stone, has had repeated run-ins with the law. His second wife committed suicide. Tonya Harding has worked hard to keep her head above water. That, after all she'd been through, she did not become a criminal, is testimony to her inner strength. That so many people gave in to bread-and-circuses demonization of her, without knowing all the facts of the case, says nothing good about people's eagerness to hate, and the tabloid press' eagerness to profit from hate."
31,"I, Tonya",9,13 January 2018,What did Tonya know and when?,"Comparisons come to mind when thinking of both Tonya Harding and this excellent film about her life and that notorious incident that led to her disgrace
and banishment. The film is done almost as a homage to the faux documentary
style that Gus Van Sant used in To Die For which was based on the Elizabeth
Smart story. Both even had Australians as protagonists, Nicole Kidman for the
Van Sant film and gloriously memorable Margot Robbie for I Tonya.I racked my brain trying to think of a sports figure like Tonya Harding and the
closest I came up with was Shoeless Joe Jackson who came from a similar trailer park background that Harding did. He too listened to the worse angels
of his nature and got himself banned for life in his sport. Jackson had far less
education than Harding did, in fact he was almost illiterate. One thing about Jackson though his choice of life partner was a good one. By
all accounts his choice of life mate was inspired as Katie Winn Jackson stuck
loyally by him and was never a bad influence.That could not be said for Jeff Gillooly who had the same kind of trailer park
background that Tonya did and who let being the husband of a celebrity just
totally go to his head. Sebastian Stan whom I consider one of the best actors
around today plays Gillooly with an explosive intensity. As the sports press
built up this rivalry between Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, Gillooly tries to think
of ways he can make himself indispensable to his wife.Thus was born the knee capping incident which gained both Kerrigan and Harding a celebrity status far beyond the world of women's figure skating. It
was done by a man hired by a dim bulb friend of Gillooly's played by Paul Walker Houser. The scene with Houser being interviewed by the FBI is laughable and the expressions on the faces of the agents just says it all.The investigation went almost Watergate like up the ladder until the real target was reached by law enforcement and public opinion. It's such an incredibly plaintive scene as Harding begs the Figure Skating Association not to
be banned. It's all she knows. The film is purposely vague as to how much 
Tonya did know.Best of all is Allison Janney and while the cast is great and many might get
Oscar consideration Janney I think is a sure bet for a nomination as the monster of a mother that Robbie has. Still alive she denies the child abuse
allegations. I kind of doubt it. Janney is unforgettable.Two scenes are also real keys to Harding's character and how it developed. One is early on when Harding berates the judges. She knows she outskated
everyone, but they remind her that form and presentation count big for them.
And later on she's told she's not the right image. Figure skating champions have to be pristine princesses as they have from Sonja Henie to today. She
does make the effort to clean up her image.She almost does and a scene that will break your heart just before the fall is her leaving an arena and being asked by a little girl for an autograph. In that
moment with dignity and class she shows herself the role model sports figure
she was expected to be. Poignant all the more because the audience knows
the fall is coming.More than would be figure skaters should see I Tonya. It's the sad story of an
American tragedy."
32,"I, Tonya",9,13 January 2018,Well Done and Entertaining,"""I, Tonya"" kept me entertained from the first second to the last. The acting in this film is brilliant; Alison Janney as LaVona Golden shines in one of her best roles yet. Margot Robbie is phenomenal, and Sebastian Stan pulls it off brilliantly. The movie overall is extremely well acted, even if you're not keen on the story line or Tonya Harding herself, I think most could agree the actors are well immersed in their roles.The movie offers a different perspective on the notorious incident that happened in 1994 where Nancy Kerrigan was unfortunately assaulted by a hit man who based in her knee where she suffered severe bruising. The attack was then linked to Tonya, since it was her husband, Jeff Gilooly, who hired the hit man.. The movie explores what was going through her head at the time it all went down, as well as all of the layers that was going down that Tonya didn't even know about. In the end, it shows a fresher perspective on the issue, as well as, sees Tonya in a slightly more sympathetic light than other ways media presented her.Aside from the incident, the movie deeply explores Tonya's past, her heated relationship with her mother and the physically abusive one she had with her now ex-husband. The film also exposes how people who didn't grow up conventional are treated in the world of figure skating, and how that put's people like Tonya at a disadvantage. It's a very griping and raw film, the dialogue, editing, and performances are all stellar; I highly recommend it."
33,"I, Tonya",9,13 January 2018,Going for the Gold,"""The haters always say, Tonya tell the truth! There's no such thing as truth.""What is the truth? Is it what we hear about through other sources (gossip, the press, television, social media) or is it only what we want the truth to be? ""I, Tonya"" takes on the controversial true story of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and the violent figure skating mele that shocked the nation 24 years ago this month. But despite the age gap, ""I, Tonya"" is a film for our times. The complicated insanity of this particular story mirrors so much of what we've been living through in this country lately. A time of anxiety, fear and paranoia of who to trust, what is right from wrong and what on earth is about to come next.You would think, in that sense, that ""I, Tonya"" would make a mockery of Tonya Harding. You would think that Hollywood would portray her as a piece of white trash from fly-over-country who got everything she deserved. We love to do this to each other. We enjoy a gladiator show of reaffirming our popular views in the court of public opinion. But ""I, Tonya"" chooses not to go down that path. Instead, it chooses an area just as problematic.. siding with Tonya Harding. Based on what we know about the case from the initial news reports, it isn't wise for any critical thinker to take Harding's word for what actually happened. We will never know for sure if she was an accomplice in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan or not. She was, at the very least, complicit in Jeff Gillooly's bungled attempt at sabotage. But in the end, does all of this really matter? Did we as viewers find it problematic that GoodFellas was based on Henry Hill's account of his time in the Mafia? Did we find it unsettling as Boogie Nights recounted the awful story of the Wonderland murders and the tragedy of pornstar John Holmes? We all did, but those are two great films. I, Tonya is a great film. I adored every last frame of this film. It is precisely the kind of energy and inspiration that keeps me going to the movies. Fearless, powerful, raw and most importantly, real. Craig Gillespie holds nothing back. Steven Roger's amazing screenplay doesn't mince words. By far and beyond, it is the best edited film of 2017. Clearly reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker. The icing on the cake are the performances. Margot Robbie is electrifying as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan plays the utterly despicable Jeff Gillooly perfectly. A soft spoken dummy and a wife beater. His portly companion Shawn Eckhardt (played by Paul Walter Hauser) is a full-on riot. The worst hitman in human history. A conspiracy nut who orchestrated an international incident from his parent's house and willingly exposed himself to the FBI. You could only find this kind of stupid in America. The role that everyone is talking about is Allison Janey's shocking portray of Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden. A commanding on-screen performance for the ages. She's a horrifying cross between Nurse Ratched and Terence Fletcher. Sometimes, the film plays up a lot of the abuse that Tonya took from Golden and Gillooly, much of it violent. It is more matter of fact, than funny. At times, it's painful to sit through. But then two seconds later, you are laughing at a funny quip from any of the characters on screen. This is real life. It's horrifying, it's funny, it's absurd. Take the trip and you will love it as much as I did."
34,"I, Tonya",8,12 January 2018,"Interesting and entertaining look at one of the biggest ""villains"" of the 90s.","This one is all about the performances. Robbie and Janney steal the show as daughter and mother. I'd say with ease that both deserve nominations. Robbie's performance is equal amounts charisma, persona, comedy, and hope. There are numerous scenes in which her eyes carry more weight than any plot point or a piece of dialogue. There are a few scenes, in particular, where her strength, expression, and persona crumbles upon just seeing her mother. It's devastating.The movie itself has The Wolf of Wall Street watchability in that it deals with some despicable people and acts in a lighthearted mockumentray style, and is about as good, too. There are several scenes that have intentional tonal clashes, where like the aforementioned WoWS, you'll be thinking, ""Did I just laugh at that?"" Yes, you did, you heartless bastard. But it was funny, indeed.I, Tonya is a very good movie that'll make you laugh, it'll make you angry, and it'll make you sympathize with Harding. Most of all, it takes these numerous unreliable narrators, and crafts a story that feels genuine."
35,"I, Tonya",9,12 January 2018,Margot Robbie and Allison Janney nailed their roles!,"I didn't expect much going into this film... I'm not into figure skating or docu style movies (as per trailer), but I have to say, this one blew me away!Margot Robbie and Allison Janney just nailed their roles! I'm sure this is Margot Robbie's best performance... she got right into her character. Craig Gillespie's outstanding directing contributes to the greatness of this film. There isn't anything bad to critique here. I highly recommend seeing this as I'm sure you'll be getting more out of it than you'd expect. A well deserved 8.5 rounded up to a 9/10 from me!"
36,"I, Tonya",7,12 January 2018,"Great movie, but thats what it is","This movie is well worth seeing; for the acting, the direction, the cinematography...But people please remember this is fiction, made to be entertaining. This is not a history lesson."
37,"I, Tonya",9,11 January 2018,Absolutely Insane,"This is one of the most unique movies of 2017 I have seen. It takes an incident that is deadly serious, and transforms it into this whimsical, eccentric, fourth wall-breaking mania fest without ever minimizing the severity of the situation, which is a nearly impossible task. From the opening shot, I was whisked away by this film. This is a movie that could be categorized as a ""ride"", which is a strange way to put it but it oddly fits. You get a great sense that every single character in this movie is chemically imbalanced, but they all justify their actions through their own twisted thinking. Margot Robbie is excellent as Tonya Harding. She completely disappears in the role, as she shows us how unbalanced Harding is, while also simultaneously trying to convince us that she's in the right. Through an ingenious use of video confessionals, we get to see multiple perspectives on different events, and we get a window into how each characters' minds work. Every character thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong, and the film captures these mindsets in a really fascinating way. Allison Janney steals the show every time she is on screen. She is brutal and ruthless, but you can understand why she is the way she is..."
38,"I, Tonya",8,10 January 2018,Uncovering a seamy underbelly,"An interesting thing happened to the audience (and to me) in the full theater that I was in when attending I, TONYA - the documentary-style behind-the-scenes look into the infamous ""event"" in 1994 between U.S. Figure Skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. The audience entered the theater expecting a rollicking good time - and at the beginning, laughs were a-plenty. But, about 10 minutes in, the mood began to change. I know I started getting uncomfortable laughing AT these players. I was beginning to get disturbed by them and as the movie unfolded, the raucous laughter turned into nervous laughter and then turned into somber silence, so - by the end - you did not know whether to laugh or cry at (with?) these characters/people.A good deal of this feeling has to do with the work of the three leads in this film. As the titular Tonya Harding, Margot Robbie continues to show that she is an actress and not just a pretty face. Her Tonya has a strong will to succeed despite the odds but also, as a defense mechanism, has an uncanny way of twisting the truth to land on the phrase ""this is not my fault"". It is this denial that, at first, is funny, but later is sad. As shown in this film, Tonya brings on quite a bit of her problems on herself and then blames others for her actions/faults, causing a cascade of negative consequences.Matching Robbie's delusion is Sebastian Stan as Robbies abusive husband Jeff Gillooly. Another actor that continues to grow and to show that he is more than just his Marvel SuperHero (Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier), Gillooly is a loser that sees his chance for winning in Harding's superb skating skills. The glimpses into this dysfunctional, abusive relationship is hard to watch, if you strip away the cartoonish nature of their characters and see the real dysfunction underneath.But both of these actors/characters pale in comparison to Allison Janney's performance as Harding's Tiger Mom LaVona Golden. This is an unsympathetic, driven character that will help her daughter win by sheer force of will if she has to. Janney's performance is superb, unwavering and stern - and that is both a compliment and a complaint. She plays Golden with a driven one-note performance. There is no nuance here - you know what you're going to get, so you just sit and wait for the inevitable blow-up to happen. Janney will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance - and she deserves to be - but I wished that there was a little more nuance (or variety) to this extremely watchable character.But that's not the film that Director Craig Gillespie wanted to show. This is a ""warts and all"" portrayal of the people and events of 1994 and so his camerawork is just as unflinching as the character's perspective on what happened unfolds. Only Stan's Gillooly seems to be truly sorry for what had transpired, the rest still sit in the delusion that what they did was ""right"" or ""wasn't my fault"".Which makes I, TONYA interesting - and a bit disturbing - to watch.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
39,"I, Tonya",9,10 January 2018,"Really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her!","'I, TONYA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sports comedy biopic about figure skater Tonya Harding, and how she and her ex-husband were accused of hiring a man to break the leg of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. The film stars Margot Robbie as Harding, and it costars Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Craig Gillespie (who also helmed 2007's outstanding 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL'), and it was written by Steven Rogers. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for three Golden Globes; including Best Motion Picture-Comedy, Best Actress-Comedy, and Best Supporting Actress (which it won). The movie (surprisingly) really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her. The film follows Tonya Harding's (Robbie) figure skating career, and life, from the time she was a three-year-old girl, until the attack on Nancy Kerrigan (Carver) which ended her career. The film shows how Harding was horrendously abused, both physically and emotionally, by her mother (Janney) and her husband (Stan). She was also treated extremely unfairly by figure skating judges, and society as a whole, because of her poor upbringing and appearance. The movie also takes the perspective that Harding had no knowledge of the attack on Kerrigan before it happened.The film actually made me feel guilty for thinking so negatively of Tonya Harding, because I always assumed that she was somewhat of a bad person. Of course the movie doesn't present her like that. It actually makes her out to be a tremendously abused, and oppressed sports hero, who at one time was the greatest figure skater in the world (which is something I didn't really know). She lost it all, of course, due to society bigotry (the film suggests). So I really found the movie to be interesting and involving, and it reminds me to always give people the benefit of the doubt (and to not jump to biased conclusions). Any film that can do all this, deserves a lot of respect in my opinion."
40,"I, Tonya",9,10 January 2018,One of the Best Movies of 2017,"I'm mad at this movie. No sooner have I just finished writing my ""Best Movies of 2017"" list, this film skates up to my doorstep and effortlessly wedges itself on my list of favorites. No sooner do I write off Margot Robbie as just a face for making the forgettable Legend of Tarzan (2016) and (gag) Suicide Squad (2016), she turns in this absolutely masterful performance. No sooner do I write off director Craig Gillespie for being a hack Disney hired-hand forced to make Driving Miss Daisy (1989)-level cheese, he comes up with this uniquely dark and comic masterpiece. It's not my fault I didn't catch I, Tonya before the New Year. I blame the distribution!The story of competitive ice skater and sensational-media pariah Tonya Harding does have a lot of blame to go around. Harding, her abusive ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, her dimwitted bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, her mother LaVona Golden, the media, the Ice Skating Association and even you, yes you, all have a part to play in what Tonya refers to as ""the incident"". The running stitch the holds this dysfunctional collage together may surprise you but at the same time feels perfectly reasonable, tragic and despite this film being set in the early nineties, altogether timely.Assuming you're under 25 and don't have the 90's Trivial Pursuit Time Capsule Edition, the story of Tonya Harding and her involvement in a vicious attack perpetrated on rival Nancy Kerrigan was very much the news story of the season. At the time, the exceptional ice skater became a punchline for the media and especially for late night comedians such as David Letterman. It certainly didn't help that her humble origins set against Nancy Kerrigan's prim and perfect media persona, aided in making her the biggest sports villain since the Soviet 1980 Hockey Olympic team.What was never shown before, during or after the hoopla was Harding's battle with abuse. The film portrays the 20-year-old Harding (Robbie) coming to skating practice; makeup barely covering up bruises made by her husband Jeff (Stan) the night before. Before even meeting Jeff, the film portrays her home life with LaVona (Janney) as just as tumultuous; LaVona making it a point to destroy her confidence nearly every chance she gets. The film also portrays Harding's wings constantly being clipped by judging committees who see her homemade outfits and attitude on and off the ice as an affront to the sports' image.I keep saying ""the film portrays"" because director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Steven Rogers make it a point to state that I, Tonya is not an official account, but rather a Rashomon (1950) cobbled from different sources. Peppered in-between the unruly narrative are a host of mock-interviews where all the characters involved are given a chance to ""set the record straight"". This is despite the movie often juxtaposing what they say with beautiful levels of Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) irony. It's a ridiculous approach to a ridiculous story and it's pulled off with the same bullish grace as Nicolas Karakatsanis's cinematography and Margot Robbie's ice skating. Thus what we see in I, Tonya is a total marriage of pacing and tone, humor and depth, glee and sadness that gainfully tells a story you only think you knew.There are some problems, largely stemming from the film's third act inclusion of what's essentially extra credit. It intones that due to our own addiction with sensationalist media, we as an audience are complicit in Harding's hardships. While I agree with the sentiment and the film does weave this new tangent into the fabric of the narrative, it does seem to come a little late to the party. Additionally while Robbie completely owns the role as Tonya, the twenty-seven-year-old actress playing her at fifteen looks a little...off.Regardless, I, Tonya is a wonder of a movie. It's a slick, funny, wild and sad little showcase about wholly unlikeable characters who manage to simultaneously be sympathetic without necessarily being deserving of your sympathy. With documentarians are mining 90's tabloid journalism to create layered, hard-hitting features like Casting JonBenet (2017) and O.J.: Made in America; it's nice to see a movie go a completely different way without sacrificing perspective. Here's to hoping the soon-to-be-made Lorena Bobbit story also rises to the occasion."
41,"I, Tonya",9,10 January 2018,"VIEWS ON FILM review of I, Tonya","I, Tonya is my latest write-up. It's a biographical pic following the skating career of one Tonya Harding and her subsequent involvement in the Nancy Kerrigan baton assault. In ""Tonya"", Harding is painted as sympathetic and misread. She gets beaten, put down, and inhabits an unsafe, toxic existence. About four days ago, I prematurely put out my top ten movie picks for 2017. After seeing I, Tonya with its ice skating sequences shot so fervently, I think I'm gonna have to make a swift revision.I, Tonya may feel like a bullet point presentation of Harding's 20-year figure skating career from age 4 to age 24. And yeah, I'm not a huge fan of inserted interviews (of the present day personas) that reek of cliche. However, because Tonya Harding was such a polarizing figure and because I remember a lot of the news coverage from 1994, I feel that director Craig Gillespie makes the proceedings a little more special anyway. ""Tonya"" is feverishly paced, with pinpoint storytelling, deadpan performances, a biting 70's soundtrack, and some nifty match edits (towards the flick's conclusion). It's equal parts satiric, upsetting, funny, and in a way, heartbreaking. I, Tonya's wiki page claims that it's a black comedy. I'm not sure on that one. I'd rather call it a comedy-drama that makes you wriggle. ""Tonya"" contains filthy, ferocious dialogue, a measure of sucker punch barrage, and an unabashed, wink wink to the audience (a lot of the actors talk right into the camera during regular scenes).Come Academy Awards time, I'm hoping that Margot Robbie (as Harding) and Allison Janney (as Harding's nasty mom LaVona) get nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively. Robbie may not look like Tonya Harding but her transformation and raw containment still comes to fruition. As for Janney, well she gives LaVona Harding a standoffish parka and some vile, spit-fire discourse to accompany her character. In conclusion, I, Tonya projects like it's touched by the cast of Duck Dynasty or the nincompoops that inhabit the The Jerry Springer Show. Its white trash residue and its sledgehammering of squeamish behavior surprisingly make it a near-perfect film. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
42,"I, Tonya",7,9 January 2018,A Sympathetic Perspective,"I don't remember the actual Nancy Kerrigan assault and the ensuing media fallout because I was too young, so I didn't enter with any preconceived notions of what really happened. They don't try to definitively say if Tonya Harding ordered the attack, because we will probably never know for certain, but they frame her potential innocence as a strong possibility. That seems absurd until you realize the incredible stupidity of her ex-husband and his friends. The film plays out as a dark comedy following the extremely unlikely rise of Tonya Harding from trailer trash to one of the top figure skaters in the world through all of the adversity with an institution that didn't want any part of her.Margot Robbie is excellent, if a little too tall, as Tonya, channeling the anger and drive that propelled Tonya to greatness and may have led to her downfall. Allison Janney is fantastic as her abusive, hateful mother in a performance that will earn her a surefire Oscar nod. Sebastian Stan is also pretty good in an almost unrecognizable performance as her unhinged ex-husband. Ultimately, I was left feeling a little sorry for Tonya because they took the only thing she could do away from her by banning her from skating."
43,"I, Tonya",5,9 January 2018,Hard to watch...,"I am not a big fan of domestic violence, even if its a retrospective character piece, its hard to stomach. The star of the movie was not Margot Robbie's Tonya, but Alliison Janney, whose protrayal of overbearing/vindictive mother of Harding was uncanny and mesmerizing. The whole movie should have focused more on that dynamic, then the rest of the film. Sebastian's Jeff Gillooly was a little unwatchable, as half the performance was him beating her. Rest of the film was more the aftermath of Nancy Kerrigan incident. Don't expect many scenes with Nancy Kerrigan character, its more a Tonya Harding centric pic. Worth watching on DVD, maybe for Janney's performance."
44,"I, Tonya",9,8 January 2018,"Great fun, Great acting. But alternative facts.","So you want blue collar? You want drama? How 'bout a family where Dad's a welder, who works two jobs so that his blue collar daughter can have the money for skating lessons? How 'bout her ""best Christmas ever,"" when her two brothers get hockey sticks and so does she? How 'bout her mom being legally blind, and never really able to see her skate. And how 'bout her brother getting into a fistfight with her Dad, and he dies of a heart attack? Nope. Not Tonya. Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya wasn't blackballed because she was poor. She was blackballed because she was trailer trash. And the pecksniffians who run the figure skating racket didn't want any WWE story lines, even though the dramas were certainly ratings boosters. Of course, like any WWE story line, you gotta have a heel, and Tonya and her friends in the Axis of Evil are the perfect heels. And, like WWE, a lot of this is kayfabe. The movie is great fun. The acting is world class, and Allison Janney seems to be a lock for Best Supporting Actress. This flick is like watching two hours of a car crash. You know what's coming, but you can't take your eyes off it. It nails the landing, especially the end."
45,"I, Tonya",7,8 January 2018,Still a fascinating story,Margot Robbie is a terrific actress - eminently watchable. But she is bit too mature and large for the role of Tonya Harding. When she and Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gilooly take over from the child actors they look ludicrously too old. But then the whole movie is done in an over the top parody style so I guess it's forgivable. The scenes of abuse from Jeff Gilooly and her mother are quite shocking. Alison Janney does a great job as the mother from hell. Sebastian is a bit too clean cut looking - white trash don't look like him. All the abuse she suffered invokes a lot of sympathy for her overcoming such grinding poverty and sacrificing so much to get where she did.Just as in real life the events of the attack are not that clear cut.Whatever it is the story is one of the most interesting scandals of the sports world and worth watching.

47,"I, Tonya",8,6 January 2018,"a film that must be seen, with great performances and a sad story but told with a humor that works very well.","I, Tonya was a great surprise for me, a movie that is fun and has a good mood even having strong scenes with aggression and insults, is a story that has many sad moments, is a movie that the public will be angry at many moments , the character of Sebastian Stan is hateable, I was very angry with him and with his attitudes, it's okay that Tonya is no saint, but Jeff Gillooly is an asshole, the performances are excellent, Margot Robbie does his best career performance , it is incredible how this actress is evolving, she manages to bring a dramatic performance and with a good mood in many moments, the film has a bit of documentary, where the main characters appear telling the story and the cool thing is that sometimes Tonya interacts with somebody who is commenting on the story, it was really cool this balcony, the soundtrack is not bad, but it's quite forgettable in my opinion, the makeup work is great, and the direction is very good, but the film has its I do not think the relationship of Tonya and Jeff Gillooly well forced sometimes, there are moments that I found very exaggerated and I do not believe that it has. happened in this way in real life, I think they will vilanize Jeff too much, even if he was an asshole in real life, I, Tonya is very good, was a great surprise and Margot Robbie does a performance that makes her a strong competitor to the prize of better actress. Note 8.4"
48,"I, Tonya",8,6 January 2018,"An American Tragedy, on Two Levels","As I wend my way through a plethora of films up for various SAG Awards _ an unusually diverse group including the likes of ""The Shape of Water,"" ""Darkest Hour,"" ""Downsizing,"" ""Lady Bird,"" ""Get Out,"" ""The Big Sick,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"" and ""The Disaster Artist,"" among others _ I find, much to my surprise, that the one I like the most is the one I thought I would like the least: ""I, Tonya.""""I, Tonya,"" directed by Craig Gillespie from a script by Steven Rogers, is a biographical film about the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding leading up to and including her involvement (or not) in the 1994 attack on her American Olympic teammate Nancy Kerrigan.The film is a deeply moving study not only of a troubled young athlete and her dysfunctional family, but a convincing treatise about class distinction in the United States and how it can manifest itself in complex, easily dismissed and misunderstood ways.For example, when the movie-Harding confronts a skating judge after losing a competition she justifiably thought she had clearly won, the judge says the jury's vote was not about skating but about not wanting to be represented by someone from the wrong side of the tracks. Among other things, she makes her own skating costumes, which are clearly not in the class of those worn by the more well-fixed competition.The movie begins in the 1970s with Tonya, then 4, being shoved down the throat of a local skating instructor by Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden, played by veteran Allison Janney (""The West Wing"") as a kind of more obvious and profane Nurse Ratched, the ultimate rotten stage mother incapable of love and caring even when it comes to her own child at her most needy and vulnerable.When the instructor balks, the mother levels the other skating tots with a coarse putdown usually not reserved for children (strong language permeates this script, another not-so-subtle reminder, and not an unbiased one, of the class distinction motif).Tonya is played with breathtaking _ and there's no other word for it _ effectiveness by Margot Robbie (who also produced). Robbie, a real beauty, makes herself much less so without the theatricality so often displayed by actresses when they are called upon to play more threadbare characters. Robbie is Harding right down to her toenails, whether providing commentary about her life as she smokes a cigarette at her kitchen table, or skimming along the ice with honest-to-goodness athletic virtuosity.Sebastian Stan as her boyfriend-turned-husband, Jeff Gillooly, whom Harding marries as much to claim independence from her mother as because of true love, is excellent as he walks the fine line between being physically and emotionally abusive even as he fights to defend her honor.The attack on Kerrigan is re-created in a chilling, violent street-crime-meets-the-Keystone Kops way that works in showing both its grotesque and tragic possibilities while exposing the ridiculousness of the misguided logic behind it.Julianne Nicholson, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale are completely believable and moving in supporting roles. The film is described as a black comedy that uses occasional mockumentary techniques (like having characters break the fourth wall and speak right into the camera), but I would beg to differ.This is an American tragedy _ a tragedy in which America itself was complicit."
49,"I, Tonya",7,6 January 2018,Scene Stealers Stole the Movie in this Mockumentary,"From the very first opening shots of ""I, Tonya"", it is clear that this movie is unlike many others. Opening with a sequence of interviews from the main characters delvulging their take on the events to be recounted in this mockumentary style dark comedy, they state, these are ""totally true interviews."" And, in fact, they are! Most of the inteviews are re-enacted word-for-word from real-life on-camera interviews and transcripts.Directed by Craig Gillespie, ""I, Tonya"" is a passion project picked-up by it's star Margot Robbie who produced the film under her production company LuckyChap Entertainment. In a Q&amp;A session with the actress, cast members, and filmmakers of ""I, Tonya,"" Robbie stated that she had started the LuckyChap company to promote more opportunities in films for women.During the Q&amp;A, Robbie stated, ""reading this script was was not only the most original, there were also a number of incredible female leads (characters)."" The script broke every rule and had a rebellious nature. Robbie said she didn't know that the story was true at first (Robbie was four-years-old when it happened).Tonya Harding, who introduced herself in the movie as a matter-of-fact way, ""growing-up poor or being a redneck which is what I am."" She was, in fact, the first U.S. woman to land a triple axle. But, unfortunately, had a tumultuous relationship with the Olympic judges which is also depicted in this fact-based moive. Because there are only three women in the world who can land a triple-axel, Harding being one, director Gillespie said they used CGI to bring the stunt to screen.""I, Tonya"" is based on the true-life events of Olympian ice-skater Tonya Harding of what drove her to conspire against her lead opponent at the time, Nancy Kerrigan. Set-up in a mockumentary with a splash of real-life like interviews, ""I, Tonya"" is reminiscent of another film that was released in 1995 (ironically, one year before the real life Harding and Kerrigan incident) ""To Die For"" which starred Nicole Kidman and Matt Dillon, also based on a true story.Unique in itself, ""I, Tonya"" as stated by its director, is a movie that breaks the fourth wall - all the characters are very rebellious. ""I wanted the script to mirror that."" In that, audiences see the characters addressing things like the script, the cameras and are very aware of the filming of the movie, which is done in a documentary style. Also, as a viewer, it's refreshing when the characters, who are clearly aware that they are playing real-life people, turn to the camera to confirm scenes that they are acting-out by stating ""this really happened."" Okay! Great! I was wondering that!Similar to other movies like it, i.e. - ""To Die For"", ""Borat"", ""Best in Show"", ""This is Spinal Tap"" - ""I, Tonya"", while a very entertaining film, has it's flaws. One of which is having star Margot Robbie also play her Tonya character as a teenager. Sorry, it just wasn't believeable. Unless it was part of the gag. Also, distracting and unbelieveable was having the same actor play Jeff Gillooly, Harding's boyfriend, as a 17-year-old, who actually looked like an older man she was dating. Again, maybe it was part of the movie's many underlying jokes. Perhaps it's their characters who are reflecting on the events, re-enacting themsleves in their own minds eyes.Because I feel like I've seen this movie before with a combinatin of the actual events as they transpired and in movies like ""To Die For"", ""I, Tonya"" was a bit of a let-down. But, for those who are too young to remember either of these, the movie will be quite an entertaining and original treat. A few things that weren't let-downs were scene-stealing peformances by actors Allison Janney (LaVona, Tonya's mother) and Paul Walter Hauser (Shawn Eckardt, Tonya's bodyguard).Interesting enough though, is how the movie also addresses the fact that for those who were alive and living in America at the time, will remember the Tonya Harding and Nancy Karrigan incident differently. Most people, as the movie points-out, remembers it going down with Tonya hitting Nancy's knee with a crow bar herself. Not true! Others, will remember the incident happening at the Olympics. Also, not true!"
50,"I, Tonya",7,5 January 2018,Unfortunate Lifetime TV Channel feel presentation,"Haven't seen director Craig Glliespie's ""I, Tanya"" yet? Not to worry, you probably won't unless the amazing Allison Janney (""Mom"" and ""The West Wing"") gets nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, Glliespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"" - 2007) presents a big screen film that has a cheesy TV Lifetime Channel feel. Adding to his odd documentary interview style directing here, is the over the top costume design by Jennifer Johnson, whose period outfits and extreme hair presentations are a distraction to the story. Margot Robbie (Tanya), best known for her ""Suicide Squard - Harley Quinn"" character plays Tanya consistently hard, making it almost impossible to be believe her character and/or feel sorry for her predicament. The handsome Sebastian Stan (Jeff - Tanya's wild husband behind the mustache) is a pleasant contrast to Robbie and Janney's (Tanya's hardcore mother) bull in a china shop relationship. Character actor Paul Waiter Hauser does a nice job here as the guy behind the Nancy Karrington (played briefly by Caitlin Carve ""Paper Town"" 2015) attact. Odd as his character is, he comes across as the most believable in the film. Regardless of the above, enough can't be said for Allison Janney's commitment to her in-your-face, foul-mouthed, distraught, put upon character. Because Janney is so well know for her current and past nice gal character roles, watching her in this role is both hard to watch, yet somehow extremely satisfying. If Glliespie has any credit coming his way for ""I, Tanya,"" it's his casting of Janney in this Award worthy role."
51,"I, Tonya",3,5 January 2018,"Wanted to like it, but just couldn't","I was able to sit through the entire movie, because I won't ever offer an opinion on a movie, it I didn't see the whole thing. As a movie it was tolerable, just barely. I didn't see any great acting going on that would qualify it for any kinds of awards. As for the subject matter of the movie, it seem like it was meant for us to feel sorry for Tonya. I was never aware of the abuse that she endured presented in the movie and I'm not even sure that it's true. I suggest that you watch as much of it as you can and form your own opinion of the material. It is watchable and most people can get through it."
52,"I, Tonya",,5 January 2018,Dialog and acting had the entire theater hushed.,"I must have been at a different movie than those who did not like it. The story is well written, the acting was excellent and the twist in the way the story is delivered makes for a memorable event. At certain points when Tonya speaks to the audience she speaks right to you. A great story to get lost in and I was not really interested in seeing this when I went into the theater."
53,"I, Tonya",8,4 January 2018,Gripping account of the most rippling scandal in figure skating,"The three leads, Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, and Alison Janney shine in their respective characters and pull you into the turbulent, competitive world of figure skating. The film makes a point early to establish these characters with honest, believable motivations and personalities and you find yourself growing attached to them despite their glaring flaws as human beings.While hinging on what they refer to as ""the incident"" as the major turning point in the story, we are also given an interesting and telling look into what it could be like for all sorts of different athletes competing in Olympics level competitions. I, Tonya is an engaging film I would recommend checking out."
54,"I, Tonya",10,4 January 2018,Enjoyable!!!!,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. The way it was made was unusual and effective. Robbie who played Tonya and whoever played the fat bodyguard were brilliant. The movie is very funny in places. I know very little about how accurate the film is, but it certainly entertained me for 2 hours or whatever...."
55,"I, Tonya",,3 January 2018,"Tonya's rough and elegant, a tough combo for figure skating.","""I mean, come on! What kind of friggin' person bashes in their friend's knee? Who would do that to a friend?"" Tonya Harding (Margot Robie)Director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya may change the way you view Tonya Harding. This gritty docudrama chronicles the life of the competitive skater who worked a lifetime to become a member of the Olympic team only to see the dream shattered by her ex, Jeff (Sebastian Stan) in the now infamous assault on superior skater Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver).Although Tonya admits to coming from ""white trash,"" she dreams of entering a world that mostly coddles to girls from proper families, hardly a term for the Hardings. Their incessant smoking and Eskimo-Pie eating are small reminders of how difficult she would have it in the culturally rarefied world of Olympic competition.Tonya displays an astounding naiveté as she places her confidence in boyfriend turned abusive husband, Jeff (Sebastian Stan). No question she knew he wanted to harass competitor Kerrigan through the mails, but she doesn't seem to have sanctioned assaulting her. Harding's hard shell makes it difficult to sympathize with her nevertheless. The crux of this revealing and ultimately sympathetic chronicle is that Harding, as bluntly competitive and rough as she is, is easily buffeted by her rude mother, La Vona (Allison Janney), whose drill sergeant ways and seeming lack of love set up Tonya for feelings of inadequacy for the Olympics and life.
 
The action of the film, well known for anyone aware of the turbulent 90's and Harding, arguably, as she says, secondly famous only to Bill Clinton, doesn't play as well as other docs that keep the audience on edge but eager for more. Harding is deeply in need of real love, a circumstance that gives the film less suspense than that of a more stable hero. I might even be challenged calling her a ""hero."""
56,"I, Tonya",8,2 January 2018,A Brilliant Film About Clashing Forces,"""I, Tonya,"" evokes lurid attention similar to the rubbernecking that occurs when passing an auto accident. Part pseudo-documentary and part biopic of an abused women who struggles within a sports system that disavows her, ""I, Tonya"" presents a true story to clear Ms. Harding's reputation in a stranger-than-fiction story.Given the gift of being lightning on skates set against a truly abysmal, trailer trash environment, Tonya glides on ice under extreme mental and emotional duress meted out by a stage-mother-from-hell, a trope redefined by a brilliant Allison Janney who steals every scene. Too, ""I, Tonya"" thumbs its nose at inspiring sports films where underdogs succeed against all odds to make it big. An unrecognizable and equally brilliant Margot Robbie tells us so with acid in her voice by breaking the fourth wall as if in a documentary.The events leading to what's called ""the incident"" (the attack on Nancy Kerrigan) are too insane to be believed. Harding, we're told, is not entirely an innocent victim, but her complicity is fairly portrayed - and payback for breaking the rules in a genteel sport where Tonya's blue-painted fingernails, self-made costume and rock song accompaniment are not welcome. At the end, she is banned for life from skating competitions even after pleading to the judge to send her to prison instead of taking from her the only brightness in her awful life.The brilliance of ""I, Tonya"" stems from juxtaposing Ms. Harding's skills against the struggles of her personal life. Her familial abuse spills over to choosing a husband who beats her for no reason. She is not a Phoenix rising from the ashes but rather a bird who tries to flap unsuccessfully from the fire only to fall back incinerated. An argument could be made ""I, Tonya"" is a feminist film but without mawkish sentiment for a poor, powerless waif. She divorces her scumbag husband only to bring him back in her life when she needs him which leads to his twisted arrangement of ""the incident.""This is God's joke on her. Powerlessness, no education (she drops out of high school to skate), an unsupportive family and the settling for abuse align. The eight hours a day practice cannot overcome the gaping hole in her soul and psyche.""I, Tonya,"" minus the skating, is the story of America's low-income underbelly where crassness is a way of life and abuse is mistaken for love. It is also a story of how people cling to insane beliefs they are something they are not because there is nothing else in their miserable empty lives. This is underscored by Shawn (a fine Paul Walter Hauser) who pretends to be an obese, overeating expert in intelligence with an IQ of ten.The intercutting of documentary footage adds spice to the proceedings, and the behind-the-scenes of Olympic worthy skating is illuminating.With rich layers, a search for truth, exciting skating scenes and a perverse underdog story, ""I, Tonya"" succeeds in every sense. The acting is Oscar-worthy for Janney and Robbie. Don't miss it!"
57,"I, Tonya",9,31 December 2017,"A raucous soundtrack, a killer cast, and Olympic drama.","A raucous soundtrack, a killer cast, and Olympic drama.The '90s were a crucible and no one realized how hot it was getting, not until the real life drama that was Tonya Harding's life kicked off the 24-hour news cycle as we know it today.In a global sense, the endgame is revealed in the first minute. We have Bobby Cannvale as a Hard Copy producer describing his show as something all the other news outlets ""looked down on, and then became."" ""Hard Copy The Movie"" would probably be better suited to a graduate media class at Syracuse or Northwestern, but for our purposes you can't get any closer to the ugly truth than ""I, Tonya.""Margo Robbie is gold, burnished by a fine supporting cast including Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, and Paul Hauser. Janney's is a likely best-supporting actress nominee, might as well say winner, right? I mean no one's asking me to hedge. Her turn as LaVona is heartrending and infuriating. You will hate her and still puzzle over why she acted the way she did and if she believes what she says.Sebastian Stan nails the voice and mannerisms of his character. It's a treat to see an actor who usually appears in action roles test himself like this. His is not a likable character by any stretch. He's an abuser at his best and a criminal at his worst. I've always been a fan of casting physical archetypes like Stan as horrid men (he dons THAT mustache and physically blends with the character, but I can't help that I carry into the movie the impression of him as a fit guy.) It forces you to look past their exterior and realize that there is no substitute for acting kindly.Robbie really shines. She produces the film with her husband. You see her love in the final product. This a story of redemption and humanization. It makes you realize what a shit deal Tonya Harding got, and how painfully young she was when all this happened.Tonya Harding is the first American woman to land a triple axle in competition. This movie made me want to get my skates on."
58,"I, Tonya",6,28 December 2017,An acting driven biopic with little else going for it,"I, Tonya is quite a mixed bag. The subject matter is pretty difficult for any writer or director to take on so it isn't surprising that the film falls flat in every area except acting (mostly) because neither the writer or director have shown themselves to be capable of tackling such a difficult subject.The movie isn't really bad it is just a very standard biopic with less than stellar writing and exceptional acting in most cases.
Margot Robbie deserves to be mentioned as someone who is showing to be a very good leading lady in drama, however I didn't believe the character of Tonya Harding in the film and I thought she was written poorly. Margot's acting was fine considering what was written for her, but the character wasn't written as ""white trash-charming"" as she should have been.Allison Janney is marvelous as the harsh and unforgiving mother of Tonya.
Her performance was believable and her character was very well written so I guess you could say that she was the real star of this movie. She was the only character in the movie that fit perfectly.Sebastian Stan was fine. I didn't hate his character and that's bad. His character wasn't written correctly at all but again, the actor did fine with what he was given.The movie sometimes does not know what it wants to be, editing wise. It has some pretty weird choices that I was able to follow but really shouldn't have needed to. In the beginning it has an interview style, then it goes away, then comes back again, then goes away and so on. Its just annoying and it should have been written as a standard biopic.
The second half of the movie that focuses on ""the incident"" is tedious and annoying and not what needs to be seen when talking about Tonya Harding. At no point in the movie except when Tonya said it , did I feel how important skating is for her.This movie could have been way better and I blame the writer and director for its mediocrity. Margot and Allison did a wonderful job, Allison especially, and I'd consider both of them an awards contender.

59,"I, Tonya",8,20 December 2017,a perfect landing,"Greetings again from the darkness. Your recollection of Tonya Harding is likely not that she was the 1991 U.S. Champion figure skater and a two-time Olympian. And rather than honoring her as the first female skater to land a triple axel in competition, you likely remember ""the incident"" in 1994 where she whacked her on-ice rival Nancy Kerrigan on the knee with a club. Only Ms. Harding wasn't the one who attacked Ms. Kerrigan ... and that's only the beginning to what director Craig Gillespie (LARS AND THE REAL GIRL) and writer Steven Rogers (P.S. I LOVE YOU, and a bunch of other mushy stuff) detail in this madcap look at a reality infinitely stranger than most fiction.Margot Robbie (THE WOLF OF WALL STREET) stars as Tonya Harding, and it's a career-defining performance ... funny, tragic, physical and emotionally charged. This isn't the expected bleak biopic, but rather it's a brilliant blend of parody, docudrama, and dark comedy focused on some real life folks that will surely make you grateful for your life. Harding's abusive, profane and icy mother LaVona is played with aplomb by Allison Janney, who manages to bring some humor to the role of a woman whose approach went far beyond the realm of tough love and straight into cruelty. Sebastian Stan plays Tonya's husband Jeff Gillooly and Paul Walter Hauser is Shawn Eckhardt, his friend and co-conspirator. In regards to these last two gents, we spend most of the film trying to decide if they are goofy, ignorant or downright dangerous (or all of the above).Director Gillespie expertly weaves together the domestic scenes, ice skating scenes, and ""current"" interviews with the main characters. The domestic scenes include Tonya and Jeff, Tonya and her mother, Eckhardt with Tonya and Jeff, and Eckhardt with his own parents. The ice skating scenes emphasize how hard Tonya worked and her relationship with Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson), while the interviews (recreated from actual interviews) provide contradictory details from the memories of Tonya, Jeff, Eckhardt and LaVona. The film tries not to make fun of them, but they kind of do it to themselves.Bobby Cannavale appears as a ""Hard Copy"" reporter who provides some story structure by walking us through the timeline as reported by the media at the time. McKenna Grace plays a young Tonya, while Caitlin Carver is Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya has long been labeled as the most ""notorious"" figure skater, and a failed boxing career was the closest she came to capitalizing on her notoriety after the scandal. Her life and the incident have been the basis for songs, books, news specials, documentaries, TV parodies, and even a Brooklyn-based museum. The film reminds us that truth and recollections are open to interpretation, and that there is much more to the story than what was reported. Respect is too much for Tonya to hope for, but this excellent and entertaining film might deliver a dose of compassion or empathy (along with incredulity and some laughs)."
60,"I, Tonya",3,5 January 2018,"Robbie is great, the film is not however..","Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes. I, Tonya might have a good perfomance from Margot Robbie but the characters of this based on true events film are unlikable from start to finish. The mother who is smoking for the entire film and beats the sh*t out of her kid, the husband who likes to have sex and then beat the sh*t out of his wife who fights back as well and they have a ridiculous love/hate relationship and final Tonya herself who is also an abusive sh*t person and i'm asking all the people who will read this review: shouldn't 'we' as an audience care about our characters instead of wanting them to be gone? That's the movie ""I, Tonya"" who even with a good perfomance from Robbie portraying that unlikable character, still can't find it's actual road of what it's trying to be a comedy or a biography? cause it's terrible on both sides. (3/10)"
61,"I, Tonya",9,3 January 2018,"""Goodfellas"" meets the ice skating world and it's awesome!","Going right into another sports movie; this is if someone were to make a ""Goodfellas"" styled film about a professional ice skater, but snorted a little extra cocaine. It is insane and amazingly edited. Hilarious, surprising that this is an actual true story, and in the end I won't lie that I held back some tears just from Margot Robbie's performance alone. If I had a small gripe, it would be some of the CGI used; while not necessarily bad, it was noticeable at times. Other than that, I loved this movie from beginning to end."
62,"I, Tonya",8,27 December 2017,Redneck VS Figure Skating,"First impression was: Wow, Margot Robbie can act? That was a shoking and a pleasent surprise. And then it got only better and better. Steven Rogers and Craig Gillespie broght to screen crazy real life story of rise and fall of Tonya Harding. Sensation and a splinter in the history igure Skating. Fantastic wrighting , rythm and acting puts this movie top 5 this year. Maybe even at number 1. This is a ""Must watch"" movie! I liked it much more then Lady Bird! It is almost ""Big short"" level masterpiece."
63,"I, Tonya",,27 December 2017,Fantastic acting,"I guess because I had no real expectations about this being great, I was actually surprised by how great it was. I admit the writing/directing stylistic choices become obnoxious at times, but they also work to make the film stand out from the usual biopic at other times. This is one of those biopics that has the quick, showy type of editing that award bodies go for so I fully expect the editing to get some notices, but it would definitely be deserved. The film moves like a machine while still keeping the character dynamics and development in tact. Overall, the biggest standout aspect of the film is its acting, and in that department it in no way disappoints. Allison Janney was the predicted frontrunner for Supporting Actress before Laurie Metcalf started beating her for Lady Bird. Since this film has come out all I have heard from those who have seen it is how this is not an Oscar-winning type performance, and I completely disagree. I am actually now surprised by how baity and typical the performance is, compared to previous winners. Now I'm back to predicting Janney to take home the big awards. She is definitely really great in the role, although I myself prefer Metcalf. But the biggest stars of the film are Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The former has deservingly been in the conversation for awards, and I would say she is in the same level that McDormand, Ronan, and Hawkins (the other three frontrunners) are. She would make a fine winner. Sebastian Stan is almost equally as great, and it's a real shame he's not getting much notices at all. It's a fantastic performance through and through."
64,"I, Tonya",8,26 December 2017,"Brilliantly written and directed, stupidly funny from start to finish!","The trailer for this film did its job and wow did this film not disappoint on what was pitched in those trailers. I personally did not know the whole story in-depth of Tonya Harding primarily because I was only born a year after the incident happened so cut me some slack. However after watching this I am intrigued with her story, even if its from many unreliable view points.Firstly the directing in this film is fantastic from start to finish, Craig Gillespie has done a brilliant job with this film there is not a fault with it. He has managed to capture the high intensity of the skating scenes which a brilliantly shot to the much more slow paced character moments. Neither type of scene seems out of place, rushed or to slow. He as a director is definitely on my radar!Next the screenplay of the film written by Steven Rogers is simply fantastic, it is some of the best dialogue of the year. It is hilariously funny at times and then in the flick of switch can be serious and grounded in reality, even though that reality is not normal circumstances. The dialogue for Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan is great but far and away the dialogue that is written and given to Allison Janney is breath taking, definitely deserves an awards nomination.The Cast is brilliant all around however I'm going to focus on the three main players of the film. Firstly Margot Robbie, who is time and again proving that she is a fantastic young actress and will go on to do great things in the future. Her performance is fantastic, its so good that you very quickly get over the fact that its her and you accept that its actually Tonya there. She embodies the character extremely well and leaves and ever last impression, you feel almost sympathy to her as if she is actually the victim? It is her best work to date. Next Allison Janney, now this actress does not get enough big roles for me, she is extremely underrated and deserves much more praise then she get. This is her best performance that I've seen, even though she is playing and extremely horrible person. Coupled together with the dialogue and the ridiculous outfits, that are perfect, she is a shining light in the film and 100% deserves some type of award absolutely brilliant. Lastly is Sebastian Stan who is again brilliant and even though he portrays a man that does a terrible thing, you again feel a strange sympathy towards him because he didn't mean it to happen, well he says he didn't but we should take that with a pinch of salt. Stan is fantastic!Overall I wasn't expecting much from this film even though the trailers looked promising, I was blown away by this film it is extremely good and it has a great re-watachability to it. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 this film is very good, extremely funny at times but does a serious side to it at times and so it should. One of the better films of the year and should definitely be on everyones radar during awards contention."
65,"I, Tonya",9,16 December 2017,Gripping biographical black comedy gave me chills,"Over time, I have grown weary of the biopic genre. It tends to yield a lot of films that are by-the-numbers and lack an edge. Enter this film that proves the exception, a fiery account of the renowned U.S. figure skating champion Tonya Harding, whose husband and friends got involved in her career in the most sinister way possible and seriously injured a figure-skating competitor of Tonya, Nancy Kerrigan who, as it turned out was equally impressive on ice.The film starts out at the beginning of Tonya's development as an ice skater, when she is virtually a child. The film smoothly transitions to her more grown-up years as Tonya morphs from an adorable little girl on ice to a frighteningly edgy teenage competitor. It is then that we meet her boyfriend, who initially seems like a socially diffident young man, but is quickly revealed to by a physically violent nightmare of boyfriend/husband. Their relationship goes through many twists and turns, but it does witness her defiant rise to greatness within her sport.The film bristles with vivid performances, the most electric of which is Allison Janney who steals the film as Tonya's monstrously cruel mother who shows little regard for Tonya's emotional well-being even as she pushes and pushes harder for her daughter to reach the top. Sebastian Stan is great as her abusive husband/intermittent ally. Margot Robbie finally shows how transformative her acting ability is in this film. She disappears into the role of the figure skating champion whose rise to fame went against the norms of the figure skating sport, that disdained her working class background.There are no heroes in this story; no one emerges looking even decent. But it's a deeply incisive story of how one person's amazing journey took a radically unexpected turn. It will strike a chord with anyone who had to cope with at least one difficult parent, which might make it difficult to watch, but it's a film of absolutely granite integrity. Enthusiastically recommended."
66,"I, Tonya",,27 December 2017,Margot Robbie deserves an Oscar,"Normally, actresses got an Oscar for emotional performances, and without any doubt, Margot does brilliant emotional acting in the movie ""I, Tonya"". But at the same time, you also have to consider the difficulty of the physical performances. For a non-professional skater, it is extremely hard and nearly impossible to learn the acrobatic jumps, spins, moves and other elements in skating. I think Margot does equally well in physical performances, and really deserves an Oscar."
67,"I, Tonya",10,13 January 2018,Tonya 4 ever! America's sweetheart!,"Tonya Harding, ice skating's most notorious villain, has been a long-time hero and inspiration in my life. She had a dream and those who loved her stopped at nothing to support her. That's love. That's how family do. Yeah I'll break a b****'s ankle if they're more talented than you. I 100% represent. What is also admirable about Tonya Harding was that after she got caught, she didn't give a **** what THE WORLD thought and got her a** on that ice. What an inspiration. Never turn back. You gotta break some knee caps if you gonna make an omelette. I am definitely seeing this uplifting movie. Nancy Kerrigan is a total fake. Deport. It's not about winning the gold, Nancy, it's about doing whatever it takes to get there. Shouldn't have underestimated your competition, Tony Harding! F*** the media."
68,"I, Tonya",1,13 January 2018,Should Be Advertised as Pure Fiction,"Don't expect a film that reveals the untold truth about Tonya Harding. This is pure fantasy. If Harding were running for political office, this would have been funded by her supporters (if she had any) to paint her in a completely different light from the truth.First of all, Margot Robbie is FIVE inches taller than Harding with a much slimmer (less athletic) physique. Putting a 90's hairdo and makeup on her doesn't come close to transforming her into a believable replica of Harding. She also speaks with a southern accent--Harding was from the Portland area, where people are hardly known for their drawls--and the CGI dubbing of Robbie's face onto the skater standing in for her was obvious and awful.But the worst part is the story. Harding is a criminal who has admitted that she played a role in the attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, who is something of an afterthought in this movie rather than the victim. Harding is portrayed as a victim and suddenly we're supposed to feel sorry for her because she endured a rough upbringing and marriage. Lots of people have crappy childhoods and marriages, but they don't plan assaults on others to get ahead.Many of the major players in this so-called ""biopic"" were not interviewed by the screenwriter, who tells the story sort of like the media reports on news these days--making stuff up as they go along without substantiating anything. Is it possible that Harding's mother was as much a villain as Janney portrayed? Sure, it's possible, but remember, the old gal worked 3 jobs at times to give Harding the opportunity to skate and if she wasn't interviewed for the film, then we are only hearing one side of the story and it is likely far from the truth. Harding was known for clashing with just about everyone, including those coaches who tried to help her, and she was always rough around the edges, making her less than palatable to the admittedly snobby figure skating world.Kerrigan remains the victim and this film victimizes her all over again, this time by painting Harding as some pathetic creature whom we should absolve of any complicity or responsibility for her actions simply because her mommy didn't love her. Abuse is not an excuse.Do yourself a favor; save your $12, look at videos on YT, and see what really happened 24 years ago."
69,"I, Tonya",1,12 January 2018,"Terrible & Trendy Biopic, and Allison Janney is Awful Too!","First off, the otherwise competent character-actress Allison Janney's highly praised role as infamous ice skater Tonya Harding's foul-mouthed, chain-smoking mother, is nothing but a lazy imitation of an angry white trash, middle-aged bitch you'd see in any movie... She's already predicted for an Oscar nod and will probably win. But if a character is portrayed as being completely negative and pointedly one-sided, where's the irony? Where's the performance? Lacking direction and awkwardly pieced-together by Craig Gillespie, there's nothing going on within this party-trick of a biopic that's already being compared to Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS. Actually, because Margot Robbie co-starred in Scorsese's modern GOODFELLAS clone, WOLF OF WALL STREET, she's a cousin twice removed within that particular cinematic universe, and, along with CASINO, he's revamped the vivacious pop culture opus three times and, with other filmmakers, including I TONYA and, years ago, BOOGIE NIGHTS, at this point the GOODFELLAS template could be a genre in itself...Meanwhile, Robbie, partially uglied-up for the role, plays it safe and bland - although she has more color than the boring male co-lead, who needed a few hundred doses of Eric Roberts' sinister yet vulnerable passion ala STAR 80 to keep this sleeping giant awake. Perhaps that's why Janney gets all the praise - in a cesspool of corpses, she's a tad better than the nothingness surrounding her.Even a dated TV movie during the actual 1990's tabloid era would have been superior since, in a cohesive three-act structure, we'd have to learn some of the good, bad and ugly ingredients that made Tonya... including the abusive husband who supposedly programmed the attack on competitor Nancy Kerrigan with his fat scapegoat sidekick... actually tick...Instead, each and every scene begins as it ends, chockful of various people, providing mockumentary-interview insight, deleting any opportunity that would lead I TONYA to not only answer a few questions but to, at the very least, answer one without all the gimmicky distractions: Simply put, this horrendous biopic is a supped-up hot rod driving in mindless circles on a dead end road - even an intentionally off-beat film needs rhythm - and a destination.

70,"I, Tonya",10,3 January 2018,Scorsese on Figure Skates,"""Bash in a friends knee with a pipe? Who would do that? To a friend.""
That line did not come from De Niro or Ray Liotta. It came out the mouth of Margot Robbie playing Tonya Harding in what I have down for the best movie of 2017.
Let me start by saying I actively dislike figure skating. And that's okay. Tonya Harding doesn't seem to give a sh#t about figure skating either, even though she's forced onto to the ice by her hell-beast of a mother almost just after birth.
This movie really isn't about figure skating at all. Its about the dark heart of America, with all its love and hate and violence, wrapped up in bow ties and glitter and put on for show in the Olympics every four years. Tonya was different. She was an athlete that didn't care about the BS, and what happened happened.
Margot Robbie most likely wont win the Best Actress Oscar this year. But she deserves it. And it really doesn't matter. With cinema the cream rises to the top. Finally, there exists in film a female antihero as self destructive as Travis Bickle. Watch this movie now."
71,"I, Tonya",,2 January 2018,WTF!?!,"This is not a review. I have not seen this movie. I will never watch this movie. I cannot believe that someone would even entertain the idea of making a movie about such a consummate loser as this little bitch.... oh, wait a minute, this is America. I cannot believe that someone would actually watch a movie about this loser bitch, let alone pay money to watch it.... oh, wait a minute, this is America. Tonya Hardon and America were made for each other."
72,"I, Tonya",8,31 December 2017,Fun Film,"Tonya Harding rises through the ranks of competitive figure skating only to find disgrace when her husband tries to eliminate her rival.This film is cleverly done. It is done as a dark comedy like ""The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom"" and ""To Die For"". What both films did was take a comic look at a true life event. ""I Tonya"" is cut from the same cloth. The acting in this film is great but Allison Janney is sorely missed when she is not on the screen."
73,"I, Tonya",8,29 December 2017,Great Approach to something we all know,"This is of course the true story of Tonya Harding. She was convicted of ""covering up a crime"" where her closest rival in skating Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee before the Olympics if 1994. Now she claims ""She Never Knew Her Husband had helped planned the attack"". This film makes Tonya look like she wasn't lying"" but I really think ""She Did Knew All Along"". Now almost 24 years later I think Nancy Kerrigan has proved she wasn't as nice as the public thought. The film is very entertaining but I think it is one sided. Its like how ""FOX NEWS Covers Trump ""."
74,"I, Tonya",9,29 December 2017,Nearly Perfect,"I was 18 years old when this all went down and the thing I thought about was ""who cares, it's ice skating?"" and ""I'll jerk it to Nancy Kerrigan, she's hot...and the crying makes it better.""
Yes, that is the history of ""the incident"" where Tonya Harding, supposedly desperately wanted to be in the Olympics so bad, she supposedly coordinated the attack on Kerrigan.
This sort of resentment exists in anything where talent and skill are in full display. The same could be said about filmmakers. One loves to throw shade on each other. But there still exists a mutual respect. That it was even made. The resentment, no doubt, boils within the person. I'm victim to it. Others are as well, but it's never voiced as openly as ""I,Tonya.""There is no way in Hell director Craig Gillespie didn't study ""GoodFellas"" when making this movie. It is the embodiment of that style to the exact whip pans and breaking the fourth wall. And he nails it! Like Tonya Harding's triple axel. Without even the story of Harding versus Kerrigan...it's still a fucking fun movie. There is so much energy and dark humor. This is the movie ""Three Billboards..."" desperately wants to be. Because the darkness to the humor is earned and doesn't have contrived brutality to make you believe it. In fact, there is a moment when she addresses us directly and accuses us of...well, it's all true, which sucked the air out of the theater. That is amazing filmmaking.
The performance of Tonya by Margot Robbie is a little bit caricature of the person. Though I think she walks a fine line. It's so razor thin and she does it so effortlessly. Like a perpetually dumb teenager who listens to ""New Kids On The Block"" it isn't a spoof. And that's the hard part about the movie. That she plays a notorious bad girl without playing it for laughs. She just...is. It sometimes is heartbreaking. And Sebastian Stan who plays Jeff Gillooly, whom I thought a buffoon back in the early 90's was a brutal guy. Never did we once believe he would end up killing Harding, but you get the feeling it was only a matter of time. The wild relationship they had almost excused it for love.The trophy definitely goes to Allison Janney as her mother LaVona Golden. An unrepentant white trash Mom-ster who is either a stage mother or a wicked step-mother. Her physical attacks on Harding seem so effortless it's the shocking part of the movie. Like after so many attacks, it became normal. She should win the Oscar for Supporting Actress (though probably not because it's an awful mean person).How do you make a film about someone everyone knows more about than you? This is the answer. Take the key players names out of the film, and you still have a fascinating film about the ruthlessness of the ice skating world (not much different than the beauty pageant). People also forget that Tonya Harding was the first American woman to landed a triple axel. Yes, folks, the only American woman who had the balls to do it. If she's chippy about her legacy, she deserves to be."
75,"I, Tonya",,29 December 2017,A captivating biographical film,"This film tells the story of a girl who is groomed to be a figure skating champion ever since she was a young child. However, her life is surrounded by various controversies. Is she able to fulfill her dream of being the champion?I must say I have not heard of Tonya Harding before, so the story is completely new to me. Both Harding and her mother are memorable and distinctive characters, and they make the film captivating. The drama surrounding Harding escalates as time goes on, and becomes a problem of almost theatrical proportion. This makes the film very interesting and engaging to watch. I enjoyed this biographical film."
76,"I, Tonya",9,29 December 2017,Outstanding preformances and Soundtrack,"We all know the story, these actors nailed it! margo was at the best ive seen her in anything yet, and the mother from Hell played it to a tee..There is a sadness to the story ,the harshness and pain of her private life, the possibilities that could have been that will never be.. the soundtrack is one of The best and perfectly matched to the cinematography...how they can make you believe that margo is doing the skating is wild,even when you try hard to see it faked ... this is the kind of movie that draws you in and hold you there till the end..great job!"
77,"I, Tonya",8,28 December 2017,My pick for best movie 2017,"So basically this is the movie where Allison Janney comes out and is like,...""BOW DOWN BITCHES""! Allison gives zero fucks in this movie. She goes for it. My god, her acting in this movie was amazing. I kept thinking....""Allison Janney, yup"". Shes doing it. She hopscotches effortlessly the line from a great actress to a brilliant actress. This bitch needs an award for real. I love her! BravoI,Tonya > Lady Bird
The Killing of a Sacred Deer >Mother"
78,"I, Tonya",8,27 December 2017,Margot Robbie playing Emma Stone playing Tonya Harding.,"An absolute trailer park, trailer trash, trash fire movie of unredeemable people in ridiculous situations. And it couldn't be any more perfect unless John Waters himself schlocked its brains out. Margot Robbie deserves three Oscars for losing herself so deep in a wonderfully despicable role. As usual, Allison Janney is at her amazing best, proving herself the Meryl Streep of brassy low-rent broads. Sebastian Stan is uncharacteristically unattractive and downright sleazeball, This movie is an emotional romp. You'll laugh like your neighbor's meth lab is leaking; you'll experience terror like a new foster kid. You'll cry like it's the shotgun mass wedding of all of your first cousins. And you'll lose control of your bodily functions like that time Lynyrd Skynyrd's tour bus broke down in front of the Route 73 shooting range - the one with the Dukes of Hazard General Lee replica, not the one with the rats that tested for plague.Sonja Henie's mother gives it a 5.9 from the grave. Nancy Kerrigan and the fishermen of Massachusetts are not amused. Style points for denim jackets."
79,"I, Tonya",8,27 December 2017,Not your ordinary biopic,"Well I am not really into figure ice skating or anything that happens on the ice at all but I am always into good story and this is truly an interesting character to put on the silver screen. 
The film was good because it wasnt your typical straight forward biopic drama, no it was a fresh, foul mouthed comedy with some little thriller elements and of course some tragic turns as well. It was film to really give Margot Robbie the chance to put out all her acting weapons and boy did she deliver! This is so far the role of her life and she deserves every kudos she receives for it. I am sure this will not only end up with an Oscar nomination but also with one of the top candidates for the Best Actress Oscar. Excellent and brave performance. Funny, tragic, sad and always with a bad mouth. Allison Janney was just as good. Sure it already was a showy part to begin with but Janney even put something on top. You never knew if you should just straight up hate her or if there is something good in her. Very cynical, very sarcastic performance. Unlike everything Janney ever did on that level and one of the best performances of this year. She really owned every scene she was in (although some scenes were stolen by her bird). Sebastian Stan was okay but couldn't stand himself too well against those two powerhousse women. The soundtrack was excellent, the direction fine and I really liked the script."
80,"I, Tonya",8,20 December 2017,Australian director and actress...,"It's a good movie that stayed with me the next day---but, the Australian Margot Robbie just wasn't the right actress to play the American Tonya Harding. There was a flavor missing in Robbie's performance. It didn't help that she actually looked a lot like Nancy Kerrigan (who also deserves a movie).
Gillespie's direction is very good---the last 5 minutes contains an amazingly edited sequence showing Harding's rise and downfall (literally). Janney was hard to forget, too."
81,"I, Tonya",8,20 December 2017,"I,Tonya","""I, Tonya"" is a difficult film to define, but is very creative in it's approach to the telling of Tonya Harding's story. This docudrama, is filled with funny moments of delusion and disillusionment. We can believe the words spoken by the actors, really did come from the mouths of the real life cast of characters. 
We can even laugh at the incredulous justifications and interpretations of events. Meanwhile, for Harding, her boyfriend, bodyguard and mother, they expect our understanding and empathy, because ""nothing was their fault"". 
Tonya came from a broken home with a chain-smoking, alcoholic and abusive mother who encouraged her to remain in an abusive relationship. It is amazing how far Tonya went considering the lack of support, education and poor role models in her life. She was a fighter, which contributed to her fearlessness on the ice. At the end, you feel sorry for her. Tonya was harshly judged and convicted of a crime she did not commit. Although Harding was not involved in the plot to injury Nancy Kerrigan, she paid the price for having dysfunctional people in her life. The US Figure Skating Federation ultimately won, because they never wanted Tonya to represent the USA and felt she was a stain to the image they wanted to portray."
