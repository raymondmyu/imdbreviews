0,The Sword in the Stone,7,22 January 2006,"For every laugh, there should be a tear","This movie is another proof of the high quality of the classic Disney films. Today feature films are quite funny too... but they based mostly on simple, crude jokes and spoofing of other topical movies (remember the bullet time-spoof in ""Shrek""). There is no substance to think about in it. You can see them, laughing about them...and forgot them almost completely a few years later. Who will remember, i.e., ""Ice Age"" or ""Madagascar"" in 40, 50 or 60 years? The old Disney classics are different, there are timeless! ""The Sword in the Stone"" contains a lot of joyful gags too, but no gag stands above the characters, no joke was made only to fill a hole in the plot. The story, the plot, and the characters are primary. And Disney add not only joyful gags. As Walt himself once said: ""For every laugh, there should be a tear."" Disney take children always quite seriously, and a lot of his early films contains a lesson for life, sometimes the lesson can be very sad and cruel, like in ""Bambi"", sometimes lesser sad, like in ""The Sword in the Stone""... but can anybody forget the cute little girl squirrel, that was left by Wart, desperately crying and with a broken heart? And Merlin's closing words about love: ""Well, yes, in its own way... yes, I'd say it's the most powerful force on Earth""!This is one of the main ingredient of the famous Disney Magic: Joy and tragedy! Another is the art of hand drawn animation. The quality of the animation went downwards at Disney after WW-II too, slowly, but surely. But in 1963 cel-animation was still on a high level. Not so good as in the golden Era, when ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"" or especially ""Bambi"" set the utmost high standards of perfectionism, but quite better than in ""Hercules"", ""The Lion King"" or ""The Rescuers down under"". 7 of 10 stars for ""The Sword in the Stone""! It is not the best of all Disney films, but quite better and deeper than the most of the modern CGI movies!"
1,The Sword in the Stone,7,1 January 2001,T.H. White would be proud,"The 90 minute cartoon is in fact the first chapter of T.H. White's novel The Once and Future King. Made for the kids, Disney does it again taking a classic story and adding fictional animal characters that can talk. Still, Disney remains loyal to the story by keeping many of the characters in the story including Kay, Sr. Pellinoire, and Sir Ector.Worth watching twice with the family. An animated classic"
2,The Sword in the Stone,8,13 July 2007,For every laugh there should be a tear,"The 18th animated Disney classic is among the most hilarious of all time. It was never very popular, which is too bad, because it deserves to be more known. However, like other forgotten Disney classics, it has been winning a legion of fans with time.""The Sword in the Stone"" is almost at the same level of the 1960's and 1970's Disney classics when it comes to artwork. It was one of the last movies with the participation of Walt Disney himself.""The Sword in the Stone"" is Disney's version of the famous King Arthur's story. Disney tells this story with its personal touch and classic humor.I don't know if the Disney version is totally faithful to the real story, but that's not the point.Arthur, called ""Wart"" by Sir Ector (his adoptive father) and Kay (Sir Ector's son), is overworked and humiliated by them both. ""Wart"" is almost like a ""Cinderella boy"". But despite these problems, he remains optimistic and still dreams about being a great warrior and a knight's squire. Somehow ""Wart"" was the inspiration for the character Taran from ""The Black Cauldron"".In the meantime, he meets the powerful but clumsy and hilarious wizard Merlin, who wants to give him education and culture. Merlin believes that pure strength means nothing when a person has no brain.Together, Merlin and ""Wart"" live great adventures, funny moments and Merlin teaches everything he knows to ""Wart"". We mustn't forget the owl Archimedes too. The owl, as you know, is usually «the fountain of knowledge» on cartoons.Archimedes is wise, intelligent, clever but also very lazy, very confident, grumpy and has a strong personality. That's what makes him so funny. In fact, both Merlin and Archimedes are a comic relief.This film might take place in medieval times (which year is unknown). But it is one the funniest Disney classics ever, like ""Pinocchio"", ""Aladdin"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Aristocats"".It has lots of hilarious moments which can make one get into uncontrollable laughter.Let me mention some of them: the scenes with Merlin and the Granny Squirrel; the scene when the dishes wash themselves and Sir Ector and Kay get a ""bath""; the scene when Kay brutally crashes with the castle's oldest tower; the part when the plane model gets stuck on Merlin's beird and Archimedes laughs so hysterically that he almost can't breathe; that part when Archimedes nearly shrinks inside his little house; the moments with the sugarpot...I could go on, but it would take forever because there are so many hilarious moments.The songs are clever and enjoyable, such as ""The Sword in the Stone"", ""That's what makes the world go round"" and especially ""Higitus Figitus"", my personal favorite.I like this movie and I've gotta say that humor is, without a doubt, the strongest attribute of this movie.This should definitely be on Top 250."
3,The Sword in the Stone,9,27 March 1999,"Not quite the book, but nice indeed..","This very nice Disney Classic was based on the children's novel by TH White. This was not yet that very well-known, heavy novel titled ""the Once and Future King"" that so many later movies were based upon, but the lighthearted earlier version. Many agreed that the later novel has disfigured the first, so that we may be thankful for the Disney version!Though it does not quite follow the book (this is hardly possible, at times) it is a very good version as animated movies go. Not tedious, though of an age where children were meant to learn something from a movie...A collectors item!"
4,The Sword in the Stone,8,10 January 2006,"maybe not one of the 'great' Disney films, but it is quite the entertainer","I used to watch the Sword in the Stone quite a number of times as a kid, and I know why later on in my years. It's actually quite a fun little movie considering its a quasi-history lesson on how Arthur (aka 'Wart') became King of England. It includes Merlin, and his 'educated Owl' Archamedes, and a whole lot of wacky adventures trying to get Arthur, who can't read or write, into a mode of thought higher than how he's been raised. For a Disney film, as well, it's also quite the quotable film at times, with some lines and situations still sticking out in my mind years later. For example, the sequence involving Arthur and Merlin as squirrels in the trees, and a small lesson in love (or lack thereof) a lady squirrel presents in the face of danger. Or the story involving Arthur as a bird, trapped in the clutches of Madamn Mim (maybe one of the funniest sequences in any Disney movie).So, as one can figure from what I've described (if you haven't seen the film yet), it's fairly over-the-top, loaded with silly-songs (one of which a true charmer involving Merlin's proclivity for organizing a packing up of his house) and little lessons for kids. But it actually is also funny for adults too, I'd guess, or at least funny to watch along with the kids. It may not be in the absolute peek of the period in Disney films (one may try to look to the Jungle Book or Winnie the Pooh for that, or the underrated Aristocats), however I sometimes come back to this film in my mind. It has a catchy attitude that made being in the 'dark ages' as fun as possible- Archamedes in particular is maybe one of the great side-characters in any Disney film.Alakazam!"
5,The Sword in the Stone,7,25 September 2005,Funny and worth watching,"I'm really not much of a Disney fan, and a lot of their films I find are sentimental rubbish, to put it bluntly. This, however, is different. I remember watching this when I was little and finding it hilarious. I hadn't watched it for years until recently when my younger siblings borrowed some videos from a friend. I still find it funny. The animation's nothing amazing, it's done more or less in the style of 101 Dalmations, and the storyline is basic King Arthur stuff (but I do like King Arthur stories anyway). It's the humour that really makes it memorable and charming. The characters have personality, there are no bimbo princesses or princes, and I find myself warming greatly to Merlin and Arthur and even grumpy Archimedes. Well worth watching."
6,The Sword in the Stone,10,21 July 2004,Not much plot but great for little kids.,"This is one of my all time favorite Disney films. The lyrics of the songs are clever and memorable. Who can forget ""Hockety Pockety Wockey Wack?"" The characters are also very entertaining. The idea of Merlin as a clutz is unique to this version of the story. Archimedes also offers several laughs.Though there isn't much of a plot, the development of character makes this film very entertaining. My four year old sister loved the film. She has already watched it at least a dozen times, and I only checked it out from the library three days ago. Modern Disney bores her. I've found that young children can't sit through ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Mulan."" This older style of Disney catches attention and entertains."
7,The Sword in the Stone,7,14 June 2006,A legendary story. A classic in animation.,"''The Sword in the Stone'''is one of the classics from Disney that I watched when I was a kid and probably the first movie I saw about the Arthur's and Merlin's stories. Wart is a young boy who wants to be a knight's squire. During a hunting trip,Wart meets Merlin, a great and powerful wizard who sees in the boy the chance to give a great education. Wart learns many of the truths of life with Merlin when he become different types of animals. The problem is when Wart makes contact with the evil witch Madam Mim, who will fight against Merlin in a witch/sorceress battle.Ps:I think it is pretty obvious to say that Wart will pulls the famous sword in the stone out of it, and will become the future King of England, thanks to his good,loyal and brave heart."
8,The Sword in the Stone,6,8 August 2007,"Good, but the magic touch is missing","""The Sword in the Stone"" is the Disney version of the Arthurian legend, adapted from the first of four books by T.H. White telling the life events of the young Arthur, before he became king. It is also the last feature-length animated film from the company of Uncle Walt to be released before he died. In addition, it is the first solo effort of Wolfgang Reitherman who would later direct other great animated movies, such as ""The Jungle Book"", ""The Aristocats"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Rescuers"".The movie was released in theaters on Christmas day 1963, almost one month to the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This dark moment in American history established a striking and timely parallel with the dark atmosphere prevailing in England as depicted in the animated film.""The Sword in the Stone"" begins by the death of a heir-less king. One night in London, an astral light comes down from the sky and a sword lodged in an anvil itself embed into stone mysteriously appears. On that sword (which will be later known as Excalibur) are inscribed these words: ""Whoso pulleth out the sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king born of England"". With nobody being able to accomplish the impossible feat, England remains king-less and the period now known as the Dark Ages begin.The movie then shifts to the great hero Arthur himself who is only a not-so-smart puny runt nicknamed Wart (Rickie Sorenson). Venturing into the forest, Wart literally falls on the house of the powerful and wise, but absent-minded wizard Merlin (Karl Swenson) who lives there as a hermit with his educated pet owl Archimedes (Junius Matthews).Merlin, convinced that the young Wart is destined to a great future despite what his physical appearance could reveal, begins to learn him about great life lessons in his fashion by changing him into a fish, a squirrel and a bird.In general, I'd say that the film is not bad, far from it, but it is also far from being excellent. The plot is generally short and somehow empty, but it also contains some rather useless over-long passages.But there's absolutely no doubt that this picture has a lot of ambitions and it has things to show to its audience. In fact, ""The Sword in the Stone"" is one of the most instructive Disney movies for the kids, not only because of the number of lessons that can be learned, but also because of their clarity and their direct character, which make them easy to catch and understand.But I would have liked to see these lessons more treated on-screen when Wart becomes king. Merlin predicts celebrity and a bright future to the young monarch, but the young boy has no idea how to govern a state. It's at that moment that the learned lessons should have emerged and Merlin should have mentioned them.After all, Wart's adventures with his mentor brought out the three most important characteristics of a good king: wisdom, love and intelligence. So ""The Sword in the Stone"" is for kids what Machiavelli's book ""The Prince"" is for adults.Unfortunately, even if it's instructive, ""The Sword in the Stone"" loses points when it comes to the capacity to wonder, astonish and entertain. The animation is often spoiled and the sets are visibly nothing more than static colored paper sheets on which animators make mobile characters streaming in and out. It's a colorful movie, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is alive.And yet, the dark atmosphere of the movie is also reflected in the presentation. Some people will say that it's OK since the pictures adequately re-create the era and the society at the time, but let's not forget that we're talking here about a children's movie. In such a case, the dark (and not much cared over) images become depressing, boring and not much enjoyable to watch.There's also a cruel lack of lively songs, which looks pretty bad for an institution like Disney. The songs go so much unnoticed that it becomes almost impossible to remember their titles.There are some great moments however. The teaching sessions were Wart becomes an animal, accompanied by either Merlin or Archimedes, are entertaining and they lead to exciting and dangerous moments, where there's no lack of thrills for nobody. The best moment remains the magical duel between Merlin and the witch Madame Mim (Martha Wentworth), where the two opponents ceaselessly change themselves into different animals and give a high-level spectacle of which we are the lucky spectators.The three main characters are also unforgettable. Wart's psychological evolution is well tangible. We can see at the beginning that he is puny, clumsy and naive, but also full of potential. And as he learns, he finds the courage to confront his adoptive tutor Sir Ector (Sebastian Cabot) and even his powerful teacher Merlin.The magician himself is presented as somebody who is wise, but also absent-minded, which renders him quite funny. Unfortunately, he often loses himself into his futuristic anticipations, which leads to pathetic anachronisms and uninteresting discussions.Archimedes is also intelligent and resourceful, but he is also touchy, cynical and often very grumpy. It means that we have as many reasons to like him as we have to hate him. And unlike Merlin, Archimedes prefers to keep both feet on the present ground, rather than thinking about the future.""The Sword in the Stone"" is not one of the greatest movies of Disney's career, but it nevertheless remains an instructive and funny picture, the kind of work that only Walt and his partners can make."
9,The Sword in the Stone,8,15 January 2004,Lowbrow fun,"This isn't usually counted as being one of the top-ranking Disney films, but I insist on not being snobbish in this list, and remembering the films that brought me joy as a kid.  Wart gets to be a squirrel, a bird and a fish during this film which plays fast and loose with Arthurian legend.  Merlin is great, and his battle with Madam Mim the stuff of legend.  It's not big, it's not clever, but it is fun!"
10,The Sword in the Stone,9,26 February 2009,Probably the most underrated of all the Disneys,"The Sword and the Stone is a very relaxing movie to watch. In an animation, you want humour and emotion, and this movie had plenty of both. Most of the humour comes from Sir Ektor(voice of Sebastian Cabot) and Archimedes (voice of Junius Matthews), but Merlin (voice of Karl Swenson) had some truly delicious lines. I just love Archimedes, he is absolutely hilarious, and still manages to be likable, despite being very grumpy. The animation was lovely, and the scenes when Wart (voice of Ricky Sorenson)was an animal were truly entertaining. My personal favourite was the squirrel scene, but the duel of Merlin and Mim was the highlight of the film for me. The songs by the Sherman Brothers, while not particularly memorable, were very pleasant to listen to, as was the incidental music by the composer of the Jungle Book George Bruns. All in all, a truly enjoyable movie, that is definitely underrated. 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox"
11,The Sword in the Stone,,28 August 2008,It's Just The First Act ?!,"Of course it's enjoyable. I love all of Disney's works at that time. There is something uniquely aesthetic, and so innocent about them; I think that's a definition of ""classic"" for me. Here, I can't help but falling in love with the colorful picture, and the soundtrack by the great (Richard & Robert B. Sherman) as creative, lovely and sweet. Just remember : A Most Befuddling Thing, Blue Oak Tree, That's What Makes the World Go Round, Higitus Figitus, the musical intro, and a piece of music I used to call it Merlin's jazz (where all the house's tools work by themselves). Since I didn't have the chance to get the soundtrack, I recorded the songs from the movie's copy to listen to them for endless times. So, is it fine ? Actually NO, it's not totally fine, since it's not a whole movie !It doesn't need an expert to understand that what we were been watching was a first act of a story. The training of the hero is part of the story, not the total thing. Even if they wanted to make it as the real deal, then this is a historic case of a deficient movie. The feeling about it is forever inadequate, as it's a perfect intro and nothing more. It even not dramatically satisfying as part 1 of a trilogy which would show us the full legend of King Arthur. The plot has no strong conflict; it's only lesson after lesson (not that memorably funny too), and the climax is weak and hasty. It looked eventually like strangely pure introduction, or eternal imperfect musical. But still the romantic and aesthetic sense of it is so captivating and very well made. In a word : it's one cute incomplete movie."
12,The Sword in the Stone,10,23 June 2011,A Disney film not to be missed!,"I cannot believe I never wrote a comment on The Sword in the Stone, my friends always joke how I'm the ultimate Mickey Mouse since I'm such a fan and I own every Disney movie on DVD. I wanted to watch one of my movies last night and I picked The Sword in the Stone and rediscovered how much I loved this movie when I was a kid and still love it today. I went on IMDb to see if I gave the appropriate rating, but I was surprised to see that I never did write about it, but I guess better late then never. Sword in the Stone is just a classic treasure that no family should be without but also the film lovers. A wonderful classic story told Disney style and filled with great songs and beautiful animation, how could anyone not fall in love with The Sword in the Stone.The ""Sword in the Stone"" appears in London, with an inscription proclaiming that ""Who so Pulleth Out This Sword of this Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King Born of England."" None succeed in removing the sword, which is soon forgotten, leaving England in a Dark Age. Some years later, Arthur aka ""Wart"", a 12-year-old orphan training to be a squire. While accompanying his older foster brother Kay on a hunting trip. He falls into Merlin's cottage, Merlin declares himself Wart's tutor and the two return to Wart's home, a castle run by Sir Ector, Arthur's foster father. There Merlin stays with Arthur to teach him the ways of the world and the magic as well as the intelligence and strength he will need for his true destiny.I think my favorite moment of this film is definitely the battle between Merlin and Mim, since this is one of the rare Disney movies that doesn't have a definitive villain, but I think Mim was a close as you could get. Their battle was epic and absolutely amazing to watch, plus I love the classic sound effects with good old slap stick humor. Also I loved the story when Merlin turned Arthur and himself into squirrels and they were attacked by the lady squirrels was just too cute for words. I know the animation isn't up to par with today's standards, but this is the exact animation that I loved growing up with because the animators seemed to have a love for the film they were making.The Sword in the Stone is a classic Disney film that should never be missed and I can't wait to show my children one day. Disney always had a way of taking classic stories that may not interest a small child and puts action, adventure, romance and wonderful animation into it and made it come to life. I can't believe I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid, because no film lover should be without this treasure, it's just so excellent and magical, takes you back to a simpler time where we were destined for greatness and the world was at our fingertips.10/10"
13,The Sword in the Stone,5,16 April 2011,Stone cold,"Pleasant Disney animation, without being a classic. It has its moments, particularly the magic-fight between Merlin and Mim, but is light on characterisation and especially good songs. The soundtrack tunes are very simplistic both melodically and especially lyrically and resolutely refuse to stay in your brain.The narrative itself is unusual, introducing the sword in the stone legend immediately and then dispensing with it until the last five minutes or so, concentrating its energies instead on young Arthur (read Wort) and his upbringing by the kindly Merlin and his obstinate talking owl Archimedes.I kept seeing recollections of past Disney (and other) cartoon forebears, everything from, naturally enough the Sorcerer's Apprentice from ""Fantasia"" and ""Cinderella"" while the chasing wolf early on is a blatant lift of Wile E Coyote in the ""Road Runner"" shorts. The old Disney trick of an experienced elder mentoring a young innocent had of course been done before in ""Pinocchio"" and ""The Jungle Book"" although I could also see some ideas which were adapted in future projects, the animated crockery anticipates ""Beauty and the Beast"" for instance.Disney never did return to the Arthurian Legnd in future animations as was hinted might happen here which is a pity but for me there's far too much diversion from the legend itself so that I was willing young Arthur to hurry up and give the sword the required pull long before the ending, which when it does arrive seems far too rushed in any case.No, not the best Disney by a long way and certainly not in the vanguard of the studio's work."
14,The Sword in the Stone,2,20 June 2013,"Nothing like the great book by T.H. White, and nowhere near the quality of other Disney classics","The book ""The Sword in the Stone"" by T.H. White is a trove of wisdom for children and adults, and a paean of love to medieval England, but virtually none of the best material from the novel finds its way to the screen in this soulless adaptation. Most Disney classics are like stepping into a fantasy storybook, but this is little more than a cheap cartoon. Something meaningful could have been made of Arthur's encounter with an amorous squirrel (this occurs while he himself is in the body of a squirrel), something akin to the beautiful and literary swan episode in White's book. But while there is a hint of real emotion in the film's squirrel scene, it is largely overshadowed by meaningless back-and-forths between Merlin's own squirrel avatar and a husky female of the species. This is representative of the movie's many missed opportunities, and its preference for slapstick over reflection."
15,The Sword in the Stone,,8 July 2011,"A lot of fun, but not among Disney's best","This is Disney's version of the legend of King Arthur and it represents an adaptation of T.H. White's children's story. Here, Arthur is a young boy who is unaware of his great destiny. He meets and befriends the great wizard Merlin who decides to give him a proper instruction and education in order to prepare him for his future.The film has some great characters: Merlin the wizard and his intellectually trained owl Archimedes are particularly funny. The animation is very good, but this is Disney after all, so you would expect it to be like that. The film is definitely entertaining, but there are a few drawbacks as well. There are moments when it feels a little too similar to Disney's other animated features from that period. The film also incorporates a lot of plot elements from other Disney movies and the film is very predictable at times. In comparison to another Disney classic, ""Sleeping Beauty"", this film looks more like a secondary project.""The Sword in the Stone"" is nevertheless a good film and it is superior to many of Disney's modern efforts (""Hercules"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" or ""Pocahontas"" to name a few). It is very entertaining and definitely worth watching.My rating: 7/10"
16,The Sword in the Stone,7,8 October 2010,Solid,"When it comes to classic Disney, The Sword in the Stone is usually overlooked compared to other sixties releases. Not one character here has had the kind of iconography many of Disney's characters have, with the possible exception of Merlin. There are no classic villains and the conflict is pretty loose and undeveloped. Despite all this, I think the film deserves a bit more love than it typically gets. It's not a great Disney movie, but it's a solid one with scenes of real note.Nevertheless, Disney's influence is notably more scattershot in this film than in any of the previous ones. This is bad when your movie is dealing with the coming of age of King Arthur of all people. Our Arthur in this tale is too damn cute for us to really buy his potential, and Merlin, though great fun, seems like just about the worst teacher you could possibly hand a student to (one of his lessons seems to be to always use magic to fudge your chores...brilliant). The various episodes generally don't add up to much of anything other than chase scenes and slapstick comedy. Considering we're dealing with an older character than Pinocchio, it's just too bad that Pinocchio had to deal with much more hellish and sobering obstacles than does Wart.If, however, we forget that this isn't a great narrative and focus on the individual bits, there's some fun to be had. Design wise, it's not One Hundred and One Dalmations but it's still loaded with some great stylized visuals and colors. Milt Kahl gets to do some straight cartooning with Merlin, and succeeds quite spectacularly, particularly in his use of hands (animators take note...Kahl was a master of that hard-to-draw limb). There's another great example of slapstick in Brian Sibley's wolf character, who is completely useless and might as well have been taken out altogether but is so inventively utilized that I don't mind him at all. I think the same of Madame Mim, who again serves a pretty dubious purpose (remember, young Wart, if someone insults you...shoot magic at them) but on her own terms is very entertaining.However, I do not have this complaint with the squirrel sequence, which is one of the best scenes in any Disney movie. Not only is it a masterful example of boarding and animation working together, it actually manages to balance some good physical comedy with a poignant message...one that Merlin's other lessons could stand to incorporate. Frank Thomas did most of this scene, and it's a great example of difficult motions handled with a strong sense of weight (one animator associate of mine played it on his ipod while doing some work, and when I pointed out how much I liked that scene he responded with ""Yes, it's...so beautiful,"" before tearing up. I wouldn't go quite that far...) Really, though, it's a shame we couldn't have gotten a ballsier version of this story. There's just not much to it. When Merlin leaves at the end, we shrug our shoulders and wonder why it should matter. Wart doesn't learn anything really, except in a few instances. The movie's quite watchable, but little else. Oddly, I think the transformation scenes must have influenced some of Osamu Tezuka's work (like Buddha) but he was much more forceful with how this pertained to character growth. If Sword in the Stone had done the same, it might have been another great and unusual Disney movie, rather than a somewhat tepid collection of solid scenes. Still, I'd consider it underrated on this level."
17,The Sword in the Stone,6,15 February 2000,Disney is almost unrecognisable,"Walt Disney the film-maker didn't fritter away the 1960s entirely - not with `One Hundred and One Dalmatians' and `Mary Poppins' - but he was no more than a shadow of the artist he had been in the 1930s and early 1940s.  More than any other animated film he made this one fails to live up to his standards.  He made nothing so nothingy.  `Peter Pan' had been bland, but not THIS bland.  `Alice in Wonderland' had been bad, but its badness was the badness of excess - in any event, it looked good and had some touches that make it worth watching.  Apart from some accomplished animation there's no evidence that `The Sword in the Stone' even came from the same studio.Writer Bill Peet's approach is disastrous - although I admit it feels incongruous to use such strong language for a film so uniformly unmemorable. The Arthurian legend, however you slice it, is a fantasy.  This treatment of the fantasy offers no magic, no buzz, no confection, no charm.  Peet is studiously detached from his material.  Why he was detached, I have no idea. He doesn't distance himself from Arthuriana in order to do anything WITH it, in the way Monty Python did.  Here we have a film that has sold its soul - or at least its spirit - and gotten nothing in return.The songs might as well not be there, not that they make enough of an impression to do any harm, the story goes all over the place without going anywhere, the art directors had no very strong ideas - how many ways can I say it?  Not that it would even be worth saying if the film hadn't had Disney's stable of animators working on it, turning out their usual good work and struggling to make an impression.  They come close to doing so in the magical duel at the end.  But even here, the dogged presentation, the way everything is telegraphed in advance, undercuts their efforts.No-one has explained to my satisfaction what happened to the old (or rather the young) Walt Disney.  So - what happened to him?"
18,The Sword in the Stone,5,11 April 2014,Not One of the Better Disney Movies,"I can't say I loved this movie. It was kind of fun but there were a lot of things that could have been better. I'm not complaining that it's unfaithful to the book, though, since I haven't read the book. But there were quite a few things that I didn't like.The main thing I didn't like was how Merlin taught Wart life lessons only through turning him into animals. I mean, he's a powerful sorcerer, right? So why not do something else? Okay, maybe one animal transformation would have been alright. If he just turned Wart into a bird and that was it and there were two other different things, I think it would have been alright. I mean, why not take Wart to Mars or something? Why not shrink him down to the size of an atom? Anyway, the part with the squirrels was just a bit awkward and went on far too long.And another thing I didn't like was how Merlin just conveniently got so angry with Wart (for wanting to go to the tournament) that he goes to Bermuda (in the future). The reason for this is pretty obvious. Just before the climax of the movie, Wart forgets Sir Kay's sword in the inn in which they are staying. Wart goes to retrieve it but the door is locked. THIS is the practical reason why Merlin goes away (the in-story reason is that he gets very angry, of course, which is just not very believable). It would look very silly if a powerful wizard was unable to open a locked door. Still, I thought THE SWORD IN THE STONE was okay. It's definitely not terrible. Merlin and Archimedes are pretty cool.It's pacing is slow but it's still kind of fun to watch."
19,The Sword in the Stone,8,28 July 2008,A different Disney film - UNDERRATED!!,"This is another one of those animated Disney films, it is another one of those underrated ones and it is based on the book by T.H White: ""Sword in the Stone"". This is different from quite any of the Disney classics in the fact that (if I am wrong here, I do apologize): it has time travel subtly intertwined among the rest of the film. It is underrated, to put it plainly, because: IT IS A VERY GOOD FILM!! :-) This film is not completely similar to the book by T.H White, but the changes that Disney made are pretty understandable, otherwise this film would last roughly four hours (L.O.L) and it would not be completely suitable for young children. As it is, this Disney film is good for people of any age!! :-)What I like about this film is the characters, the way the makers formed the plot, the songs (which consist of two, which is a little too few) and the humour (which comes predominately from Merlin).As you may have realised, this film is one of many interpretations of the story of King Arthur. Here, Arthur does not pull the sword out of the stone until the very end and it is mostly about him learning of the world with Merlin.I recommend this to anyone who likes Disney films, of all ages, very well worth watching! Enjoy ""Sword in the Stone""! :-)"
20,The Sword in the Stone,7,6 July 2008,Great Animation,"I only had very vague recollections of this movie until I watched it again just recently and I've decided this is kind of an underrated film.I'm not all that familiar with the original story of the Sword in the Stone aside from the obvious more famous bits but I imagine the story guys on this movie took a lot of liberties. When it comes right down to it the plot is little more than a lot of fluff to fill running time until Arthur AKA Wart gets to the sword. Fluff or not though the film's entertaining enough and allows for the great animation that I found to be the stand out quality here.I'm an animator myself so maybe this means more to me than the average audience, but the character animation on Merlin and Madam Mim can easily go head to head with Disney's more highly regarded classics and the use of effects is remarkable (in classical animation, effects refer to any animation that's not a character i.e. water, smoke, fire, dust etc.) Everything from rain storms to pixy dust is masterly handled and adds a whole layer of wonder to the whole thing. The highlight for me was a showdown between Merlin and Mim in which they morph into a variety of creatures to battle one another and no morph looks the same twice.This is just light hearted entertainment. It's definitely geared more for kids but if you're an animation fan it's worth watching for that alone."
21,The Sword in the Stone,3,8 December 2013,Young King Arthur,"Walt Disney produced this animated version of the legend of King Arthur and the wizard Merlin, who in this adaptation teaches a young Arthur(nicknamed Wart!) the ways of the world, and how to read, etc. He is helped by Archimedes the wise old owl, though Arthur's bumbling and idiotic relatives are a hindrance, as is evil Madam Mim, a witch who wants to battle Merlin out of professional jealousy and overall malice. At one point, Arthur finds himself transformed into a squirrel, and must fend off the affections of a lady squirrel(a most sad interlude in the film, and also its highlight). Misfired film is a real disappointment; it looks inexplicably cheap, and the story is dumbed-down and charmless, not to mention tedious. Watch ""Excalibur"" instead!"
22,The Sword in the Stone,5,14 September 2002,A simple movie from Disney,"""The Sword in the Stone"" is a good effort from the Disney animation studio. For some reason, it just felt a little different from some of the other Disney classics. The movie didn't have as many songs, and I feel that is a major characteristic of the early Disney animated classics. I think would have preferred more songs. Character development was good in the movie. It was fun to watch Merlin's character and listen to him talk of events in the future. Overall, this movie just seemed average when compared to the other Disney classics. It almost felt like they wanted to do a King Arthur cartoon, but no one really wanted to put a lot of effort into it. The story of Arthur saves the movie however, as his story has always been one the world has been interested in."
23,The Sword in the Stone,7,23 March 2007,"Not A Masterpiece, But Quite Endearing","Well, I wouldn't call this one a masterpiece. Considering everything the Arthurian legends engenders, there was a LOT left out of this one. The Merlin is downsized to something which strikingly resembles the possible progenitor to the blue genie in later Aladin, but he's still quite endearing. Actually, Archimedes is the real star of this work, but that's okay, too.The story was not ground-breaking, but does maintain the ability to remain mildly amusing, peppered throughout with some truly comedic moments (usually by way of exchanges between Archimedes and the Merlin).Some of the original Arthurian characters are included, lending at least something to the story that isn't a talking animal, or some other Disneyism, and I found this to be very enjoyable.Comedy, rather than story or character, is the main drive behind this one, and as such, it rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :."
24,The Sword in the Stone,,18 May 2014,A Funny and Magical Cartoon by Disney,"This is a really good movie, considering it's a cartoon. Good animation, story, characters (my favorite character is Merlin), songs, music, art and dialogue. There were times when I felt sad, but the movie was mostly of a comedic and fantasy medium. I also like the way it's drawn and created, it's very much a late 50s/early 60s production, which it is in fact December of 1963 upon its release date in the United States. It's hard to believe it took 3 years to make the movie. Though it was conceived in as early as ca. 1949. A great movie for ages (in my opinion) 7 to 107. I recommend this movie to people who like cartoons, fantasies, comedies, musicals, dramas, and kid-friendly movies. It may not be the most historically accurate movie in the world, it still rocks nonetheless. Charming entertainment for little kids and adults alike."
25,The Sword in the Stone,8,3 August 2008,"Not one of Disney's most popular animated features, but not one that I dislike","I remember watching this 1963 Disney effort a number of times during my childhood in the '90s (like I did with several other Disney films I saw, whether they came before or after Walt Disney's death in 1966), so, like most of them, I obviously quite enjoyed it. I've revisited a number of Disney flicks I saw as a kid within the past couple years, but it wasn't until last night that I finally got around to revisiting ""The Sword in the Stone"", probably for the first time since sometime back in the day. Yes, I may have enjoyed it slightly more as a kid, but revisiting it after all these years certainly didn't leave me sorely disappointed.In England long ago, after the king dies, a sword in a stone appears, with a message on it saying, ""Who so pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise King born of England."" Sadly, nobody succeeds in pulling out the sword, so it is soon forgotten, and England goes on without a king. After this, England is in a state of anarchy, and a wizard named Merlin, who lives in a forest with a talking owl named Archimedes, knows that an unknown guest of some significance will drop in soon, a boy around eleven or twelve years old. This boy turns out to be Arthur (a.k.a. Wart), an orphan who lives in the castle of Sir Ector, and hopes to become the squire for his boorish foster brother, Sir Kay. However, Merlin sees that Arthur can get farther in life with more education (which the boy doesn't have a lot of), so he begins to educate him by using his magical powers to turn him into different types of creatures and taking him on adventures. However, during the process, Arthur sometimes finds himself in more trouble, and things may not quite go the way Merlin originally thought.Unsurprisingly, this film features some fine animation. I was particularly impressed with some of the forest backgrounds. There's also a lot of humour to be found, especially with Merlin and some of his frustrations, tricks, etc. The humour in the film starts very quickly as soon as Merlin appears and has trouble with the well outside. After that, the character provides many more laughs, such as when he makes the dishes wash themselves to music as they float through the air (which really freaks Sir Ector out when he sees it, and leads to some funny slapstick) the part where he and Arthur are squirrels and a Granny Squirrel won't leave Merlin alone, etc. Some of these I found to be hilarious! Archimedes can also be humorous with his bitter, obnoxious demeanor, and certain other characters sometimes add humour as well, such as an evil witch named Madam Mim who appears in a segment later in the film. Aside from the humour, there are also some moments of suspense, such as the sequence with Merlin and Madam Mim going head to head in a dangerous competition with their magic, as well as some fairly sad or touching moments.Of all the full-length animated motion pictures Walt Disney produced in his career, ""The Sword in the Stone"" is certainly not one of the most widely recognized. Without a doubt, it is by no means as popular as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Peter Pan"", ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", and others widely hailed as classics. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad one. It may be a tad different from most Disney films, and not exactly one of the best, but with the merits I found in it, I think it's a tad too overlooked, and deserves more attention, so if you haven't seen it, you might want to if you want a humorous telling of the story of King Arthur's beginnings, based on the book by T.H. White. At any rate, it's definitely better than the last King Arthur movie I watched, 1995's ""A Kid in King Arthur's Court"", a somewhat cheesy and forgettable live action Disney flick which deserves its significant lack of recognition."
26,The Sword in the Stone,8,8 May 2003,"A walk down memory lane - now I think I know what the ""Disney Magic"" was","Ah, the memories.I, as many of the children of my generation, saw *all* the Disney classics the way they were meant to be seen - on the big screen, with hundreds of little kids (like myself) hollering and buying Disney figures, running up and down the aisles, and generally, well, being just kids. It wasn't so long ago, so don't snicker. I am merely 28 years old. But there were a couple of good things about not having DVD players or the like; one of them, the whole Sunday afternoon experience of going to the movies.I do remember my parents' driving my cousins, my sister and myself every time one of Disney's classics were shown. There was this huge movie house which resembled Disneyland's Castle around here, and they used to play Disney-only features. Imagine that. A giant movie theatre (where now an 8 -yes, EIGHT- screen cineplex stands) exclusively for Disney made movies. But I digress.Enter ""The Sword in the Stone"". Since I thought it might be a good idea to revisit all my childhood movies, and try to understand what I liked about them some 23 years ago, I got a couple of them. I sat and watched this movie. Then it came to me. It was so clear.What we used to call ""The Disney Magic"" is no magic at all. It's actually some content, intelligently mixed in with the humour and animation. It really seems to me Walt Disney had a hand in all of this, if just because every movie made by him has it. It's simple, actually. Each one of his film simply praises human values in a very low-key way. This movie, for example, praised education, courage, and will. Young Wart's journey from a little orphan kid to the Kingdom of England is full of very low key examples of Merlin conquering evil by the way of knowledge.Each Disney film praises, in some way or another, values that we can relate to nowadays. And that's the reason so many of his films are now classics in my book - just because I'd like my own kids to grow up learning that truth can beat a dragon, and knowledge can make you a king."
27,The Sword in the Stone,4,10 May 2017,King Wart,"Disney films are almost always great, especially the animated classics. Sadly, The Sword in the Stone is one that doesn't really hold up whatsoever. With an overabundance of goofy humor, no antagonist, little plot movement, and an ending that comes out of nowhere, The Sword in the Stone is a disappointing take on Arthurian Legend. At this point, pretty much everyone knows the basic story of King Arthur, so I guess the film ignoring most of what makes the legend popular is a bold move, but it isn't one that the film benefits from. I understand that this film deals with a young Arthur, or better known as Wart, but I'm not a fan of watching an 80-minute adventure that has little to do with anything involving King Arthur. The worst part is, the title only applies to the last 10 minutes, with the rest of the movie failing to set-up any potential payoff the ending could have. If this film wasn't titled The Sword in the Stone and didn't share some of the names of famous people, I think I could have enjoyed it a little more. Merlin and Wart go through several entertaining adventures involving many different animals and obstacles that I'm sure would be fun if it weren't supposed to live up to the legend of King Arthur. With that said, there is basically no plot at all. Merlin comes across a scrawny and clumsy boy named Wart and he just assumes that he is destined for greatness, but there's never any real movement on that besides a few training sessions. Training sessions for what you ask? It's never made clear. As I said before, if it weren't for the title this could be viewed as a halfway decent animated adventure, but the film hardly does anything to live up to the name.4.7/10"
28,The Sword in the Stone,,29 July 2015,"Animation quality takes a dip, but the characters are fun","The Sword in the Stone is one of the scratchiest Disney movies. At the time they were still experimenting with and getting to know the Xerox system, allowing them to produce animation with a smaller budget, but with a noticeably rougher outlines and simpler character models. And it shows. The Sword in the Stone is one of the worst looking Disney films, there's really no way around it. But, it makes up for that, at least partially, with some catchy tunes from the Sherman Brothers, and with fun, memorable characters.The story is basically that from T. H. Stone's novel of the same name. Merlin is a wizard who ages backwards in time - it's complicated - and he's the one who mentors Arthur Pendragon in his early days as a page in a distant, rural castle in the English countryside. That mentoring mostly consisting of him changing Arthur into various animals and watching as he almost gets eaten. Happy fun times for the whole family.In all seriousness though, Merlin is a great character. Good lines, classic character design, the best song in the whole film and his various hijinks with Arthur's life do keep us entertained throughout the whole film.What keeps this from being a greater Disney film is that the story itself doesn't really contain all that much and that the side characters are not that interesting. In the book we have knights, creatures of the forest, Robin Hood of all things, villagers, castle folk. None of which we see in this film. It's just Merlin, non-speaking animals and Arthur most of the time. It's kind of fun, but the book had potential for so much more. Imagine if they did King Arthur during the 90s, in the middle of Disney Renaissance. That would have been amazing. Just think about it.In the end The Sword in the Stone is a perfectly good children's film with a more relaxed tone than was typical for a Disney film at the time. It's not bad, but it's unfortunately not great either."
29,The Sword in the Stone,5,12 October 2014,"The Dark Ages via Disney; bursts of color, lots of talk, middling interest...","In medieval times, Merlin the Magician tutors a 12-year-old boy through educational magic; the lad, nicknamed Wart, is the future King of England, King Arthur, though what he learns from being temporarily transformed into a fish, a squirrel, et al. isn't made clear. Animated adventures from Walt Disney is heavy on both the slapstick and the talk--the former a handicap because of a lack of visual wit, the latter a detriment because the characters aren't very interesting. The picture has nice color, and a funny supporting performance from Junius Matthews as Archimedes the owl, but the main set-piece (a showdown of magic between Merlin and his nemesis, Madam Mim) is just a flurry of activity, magic without boundaries for easy laughers. The intermittent songs, by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, are weak (and unsingable) and the character of Wart, hindered by poor vocal work, fails to emerge. ** from ****"
30,The Sword in the Stone,7,1 January 2010,Pretty good,"While Carsten Corleis' review on here hits the nail on the head and I thoroughly recommend reading it, I'll give you my perspective.This is not a perfect movie by any length, but it has heart. There's happiness and there's sadness. It features one of the most powerful scenes in a movie I've ever seen. The young female squirrel with tears in her eyes and a broken heart is just so heart-wrenching.We must remember that kids need to see the good and the bad to have moral perspective. And let's face it, you wouldn't see such a sad scene in today's animated movies. And if you did, it would be made happy by the movie's end.The story is a bit lacking, but it's a kids movies at the end of the day.Merlin's final line of the movie is far more powerful and takes on a different meaning that it would have had back in the day as a simple joke: ""Motion picture...that's like television, without commercials."" The irony is a bit too much to bare. This is an innocent wee movie, definitely one to show the kids. 7/10"
31,The Sword in the Stone,7,12 March 2006,Classic Disney,"According to my dear ol' dad, this is the very first movie I ever watched, and what a great introduction to the world of film it was! I enjoy this as much now as ever, in fact I still laugh out loud fairly often...mostly at Archimedes the Owl, he was a hoot! (Pun intended). Even after all these years, I could still sing along to many of the songs! Many of the jokes will fly right past children, and I found myself laughing at every single thing Merlin said referring to present times. The lines he has at the end of the film are suitably hilarious, and a great way to end a great Disney film! For all of us that grew up with this movie, it is a classic that the youngins can still enjoy today!7/10"
32,The Sword in the Stone,,28 April 2004,It's just funny,"Plain and simple, I just watch this movie to laugh at the horrendously stupid things little Arthur does being such a simpleton.  He is weak, scrawny, and naive-a combination that only results in laughs.  I mean when he first introduces himself: ""My real name is Arthur, but everyone calls me Wart.""  He doesn't even get the fact that people are making fun of him. Like everyone else says it is different from other Disney movies, but I like it for its unique character.  The animation is not done as well as some of the other disney movies, but then people who watch this movie, watch it for the sake of reminiscing about their childhood, or for comic relief."
33,The Sword in the Stone,,26 November 2000,Disney Fun!,"Well, The Sword in the Stone doesn't live up to Disney's standards, still it is much fun... especially for kids who tend to like anything animated whether good or bad. The animation, again- while not on Disney's high standards is still very entertaining. In fact this movie is very laid back, it doesn't demand much though or depth. Humor is it's high point, Merlin is one wacky wizard and Wart (aka Arthur) is very lovable. The squirrel scene is very cute, as is the fish scene. Madame Mim clearly isn't one of Disney's scariest villains, in fact I wouldn't even really call her a villain. Merlin and Wart encounter her only once, still she is very entertaining and funny, kid will love her. And chicken pox- what a way to be defeated. All in all the Sword in the Stone is a very fun family film. Kids will love it, though adults may think it's a tad too childish. Me, being a Disney fan didn't mind the childish manner of it- in fact that's one of the things that made this movie more enjoyable. Definitely a keeper, though perhaps not in the top 10 list. Very fun film."
34,The Sword in the Stone,9,31 December 2013,A fun and underrated Disney flick that never received a lot more recognition,"Seriously, why didn't this movie received better than the reception it had? I thought that this was a very underrated Disney flick next to Robin Hood and The Black Cauldron. Sure, it's not in the same depth as the later films including most of the Renaissance films, but it's still a good movie to watch for the whole family. Now that it celebrated it's 50th Anniversary, this is my final review for 2013 before 2014 starts.It tells the story bout Arthur/Wart, a measly servant knave who dreams of becoming a knight but is barely certain he may act as squire to castle lord Sir Ector's son Kay. Then, the sorcerer Merlin and his grumpy, talking owl Archimedes invite themselves to the castle and move into its dilapidated north tower. Merlin, who can magically access the future, intends to prepare Wart for a grand future, so he gives the squirt dangerous lessons, transforming themselves into animals to learn the mental skills befitting a knight and a ruler.With that said, there are a lot of good things about this film. The animation is beautiful and it's character animation is decent. The characters are likable and the voice acting is solid. The story has heart and comedy mixed perfectly, the writing is excellent, and there is a great moment where Merlin battles against Madam Mim in their animal forms which made the whole movie worth it. The songs, while not the best work from the Sherman brothers, are tolerable enough to listen to and the music score is solid.Overall, The Sword in the Stone came this close to becoming a masterpiece, but with all of my heart, as a Disney fan, this is an extremely underrated movie that deserves a lot more recognition than the reception it received. Thumbs up! :)"
35,The Sword in the Stone,9,28 July 2013,A triumph of fun and intelligence over animation ,"just like brain over brawn, Merlin's eternal motto.The initial reactions to ""The Sword in the Stone"" left me astonished. How could such a merry and original piece of animation get such negative criticism? From what I've read, nothing was spared: the animation didn't match the quality of previous Disney's works, the episodic structure lead to a conclusion disappointing because of the lack of a memorable plot line or a clearly defined antagonist  in this list of flaws, where I only concede the issue with Wart's voice, nothing seemed enjoyable enough to redeem the film: not Merlin's eccentric personality, not the humor made of unusual anachronistic references, not even the scene- stealing exuberance of Madame Mim.Well, since reviewing is about giving opinions, I'll give you mine: ""The Sword in the Stone"" was victim of an unfair bias constantly leaning on Disney's 'Golden Age' standards, while for one thing, it was a respectable attempt to take some distance from the usual formulas (and I'm pretty sure viewers enjoyed the new storytelling format, since the film ended-up being one of the highest grossing of 1963). And now that these fifty years of existence did justice to ""Sword in the Stone"", now that there are enough Disney animated features to make a clear distinction between the indisputable classics, the underrated gems, and the forgettable ones, I think we can all agree that ""The Sword in the Stone"" is in the same league than ""The Jungle Book"" or ""Robin Hood"", all contained in that entertaining parenthesis of the 60's-70's. And it's precisely the sketchy animation so typical of that period that elevates ""The Sword in the Stone"" to more interesting level of appreciation, more focused on the story, as the counterpart of such ambitious projects like ""Sleeping Beauty"", a film of dazzling imagery but certainly poorer story-wise. ""The Sword in the Stone"" is an educational journey guided by Merlin the wizard, whose long beard, blue pointed hat and long robe belong to the best of Disney iconography. His disciple is Wart, a twelve-year old boy, whose destiny is to become the future legendary King Arthur. The mentorship goes through different stages, using magic as an accessory but never as the crucial tool, in order to make Wart learn from practice, the values of the driving forces of our universe: physics, gravity or survival, all the stuff that makes 'things go round' and the greatest lesson of all being that brains always triumph on brawn.This 'brains over brawn' dichotomy is the pattern that forged human civilization and Merlin's divinatory power allowed him to check the validity of his point, what Wart would only see through experience. The film is made of many vignettes during which Arthur is turned into an animal. As a fish, he's victim of a bullying bull-frog before confronting a pike, as a squirrel, a female gets infatuated with him, turning the lesson on gravity into one about a much greater force. The third lesson involves Arthur as a sparrow learning to fly with Merlin's owl Archimedes, but his abrupt encounter with the witch Madame Mim, Merlin's archenemy, leads to one of Disney's greatest moments: the wizardry duel. The sequence is a triumph of imagination and animation combined, having both characters turning into various animals while conserving their defining traits is a delight to the eyes, and it concludes perfectly with Mim finally ""catching"" Merlin' but not the way she intended.Again, Merlin always proves his point.The secret of ""The Sword in the Stone"" lies essentially on its relative absence of a plot, and the episodic structure, which constitutes the basis of Merlin's mentorship. Each sequence is not only full of educational and philosophical value but stands alone as a great moment of animation. The fish part involves Arthur's first confrontation with a giant predator and the first opportunity to use his brains by turning his smaller size to his advantage. In the process, it also unveils an heroic facet in Archimedes' grouchy personality. The squirrel part, after a series of laughs driven by Merlin's misadventure with a fat beaver-like creature, finally illustrates Disney's formula that for every laugh, there should be a tear. And even if it's not 'Bambi' or 'Lion King', there's something extremely poignant and heart-breaking in the squirrel part's conclusion, even more because it's unexpected.But there are laughs in the film, and quite a lot, ""The Sword in the Stone"" is full of anachronisms, of priceless interactions between Merlin and Archimedes, who make a great pair of ""Grumpy Old Men"", and some hilarious scenes involving a wolf that have irresistible Warner Bros cartoon vibes. And the few songs are so catchy we end up inevitably humming them while enjoying the animation.Who can resist to the sight of Merlin's furniture lined-up with a hot-tempered sugar pot on the lead, and being reduced over and over again to fit in a ridiculously small bag, or to the dishes washing by themselves motivated by all these ""Hockity-Pockity"" or ""Higites-Figitus"", which sound like improvement on ""Cinderella""'s 'Bobbidi-Bibbidi""?The film isn't flawless, the irony is that the more you like it, the more you watch it and discover some bits of repetitive or lazy animations. But ""The Sword in the Stone"" works thanks to its independence from a plot line's tyranny. Granted the film doesn't feature all the Disney archetypes, Mim is the main antagonist but not the larger-than-life villain with a heart- pounding demise. Even Arthur's foster father Ector has heart and his son Kay is more of a dim-witted comic relief. No abundance of songs, no memorable climax either except from the wizardry duel and the magical sword moment, but despite all these missing elements, ""The Sword in the Stone"", through its difference, marks itself among the most memorable work from Disney studios with an undeniable educational, intellectual and philosophical value."
36,The Sword in the Stone,5,20 April 2013,7th out of 8 in the Silver Era,"After the success of 101 Dalmatians, The Sword in The Stone was released in December of 1963, and the last animated film Walt Disney would see completed and released.The story is about a Wizard named Merlin, who teaches Arthur about life lessons and how to use his brain, as Merlin knows that Arthur is going to be something big. Arthur pulls out the sword, making him king.Most of the characters in this film are extremely boring, except for Madame Mim and Merlin. Mim is the bad wizard who appears in the last 15 minutes of the film, and is a bit bubbly despite being evil. Merlin is the original Genie with all the modern day references, and is the comic relief; he is a cool guy. Arthur does not warrant any interest at all, and the fact that he is voiced by 3 VOICE ACTORS is probably the only thing that stands out about him. All of the other characters (the deadhead father and son, etc) are extremely forgettable.This movie only has a few songs. ""Higitus Figitus"" is a Bibidi Bobidi Bo type song, but played down, and ""Madame Mim"" is just alright. The introduction song is pretty neat though. The soundtrack is just alright.The animation is not up to par with the previous films, and the Xerography in this movie makes it even more bland and forgettable than it is; they should have used the animation from the 50s, but that was too expensive. Here is where the reused animation in Disney films start to become obvious, as you would see the same animation sketches in the next few movies. The character designs are alright, but the animation is good when Merlin is using magic.With the weak plot, mostly weak characters, and everything else average, this movie is where the magic in Disney films start to wane away. This film is not very memorable, but there is some good and entertaining parts in the movie (Merlin vs Mim, squirrel scene). If you want to watch a Disney film that you have not watched in a while, this may be the movie. Give it a watch, you will find some moments you like, but don't expect it to be a great movie."
37,The Sword in the Stone,10,28 February 2014,Sword of Truth,"I love the King Arthur legend, it's always been one of my favorite fantasy tales. Probably one of the reasons is the fact that it's inspiring, that a greatness exists in all of us.This is one of my favorite animated movies and as you guessed it relics from my childhood. I saw this film when I was 7, I loved it then and I love it even as an adult. This film also was what introduced me to the King Arthur legend, so if it wasn't for this film I never would of known about the story.Not a lot I can say, I love the story, it's straightforward and simple but that why I love it. The animation I think is very good, it's nothing totally revolutionary but it's great in capturing a period in time long gone and the character animation is solid. The music is good it's not quite memorable which to me is probably the weak point of the film, thought the score that stands out was in the discovery of Excalubur which I thought was cool had a spiritual tone to it. However this weakness has an advantage from the fact there there really aren't many music numbers which I'm fine with since I'm not a fan of musicals.The characters are solid, Arthur is a decent protagonist, not much to say about him his the typical underdog but what makes him stand out a bit is the fact he's sympathetic. This guy practically gets crap canned left and right, from his jerk of a brother, down to the amount of responsibilities that have been dumped on him. I know there's such a think as teaching a kid responsibility but having to clean which looks like three dump truck loads of dishes by hand, that's just going overboard. This just all the more makes us want Arthur to win in the end.However, the three that stand out are Merlin, Archimedes, and Madam Mim.Merlin is pretty much a mentor figure but he's a fun one. He's got some great lines but I like that he's kinda an eccentric as we can easily see from his workshop which just looks clutter just like his mind.Archimedes is kinda the straight man or owl. He's wise and is always trying to keep things in balance. It's just funny how much grief Merlin gives him as things get out of his control.Madam Mim she's a fun villainous whom kinda was a villain that just pop out of the blue. She's just a crazy witch, she doesn't really have much of a goal except just to one up Merlin which seems to be her only goal.I really like the back and forth between Arthur and Merlin which is funny but also meaningful and touching. It's sort of like Dannel and Myugi in ""The Karate Kid"" just as Myugi teaches Dannel Karate he also teaches him the philosophies of life. Same with Merlin whom teaches Arthur lessons about the world he's also really teaching him to have faith in himself.One of my favorite sequences and one of my favorite one on one battles is the magic duel between both Merlin and Madam Mim. It is one of the most exiting, hilarious, and craziest battles I've ever seen; it's by it's nature a game of high card as both of them are trying to metamorph into a creature that can overpower the other. They turn into all kinds of animals as well as some creatures that don't exist except in imagination.Another favorite sequence is of course the discovery of Excalibur (which I think is a beautiful design of the sword) and the drawing out of it. In a way the story I've always felt was also a Christian story since the them I felt was about faith. The problem with Arthur was that he never really believed in himself or that there is greatness. His reason for drawing out the sword was to help someone, he even does it a second time because it was the right thing to do. To me those are genuine reasons for the sword to be drawn out, it was never about physical strength but spiritual. Arthur spirit was strong because he wasn't desiring to be King or any other selfish ambition but simply just to do the right thing which I feel is what fuels belief in oneself, and with that kind of faith one can accomplish anything but most importantly be what they deserve to be.It wasn't just a sword that Arthur drew out but the truth about himself and his own greatness, the greatness that exists in all of us.Rating: 4 stars"
38,The Sword in the Stone,8,13 November 2013,"Incredible Movie, But Should Have Just Called It ""Merlin""","This is one of my favorite Disney movies. I've watched it since I was a little kid and a it still entertains and makes me smile to this day. However, while I originally just watched it blissfully, my adult mind has asked me ""Why do I like this?"" So here's what I think of this great Disney classic: First of all, being Disney, this has nothing to do with the original book, but, again being Disney, they created a great story with lots of imagination. The main story is a young Arthur(sometimes referred to as ""Wart"") falls into the cottage of Merlin, the most powerful wizard. Merlin, being a soothsayer/time traveler, knows of Arthur's great destiny, so he begins to teach him valuable life lessons that will help him lead righteously. What follows are a lot of funny adventures with fun animation and characters.I LOVE Merlin in this movie. He's easily in my Top 5 Best Disney Characters List. Instead of being stuffy and wise, as most versions portray, he's more like a bumbling English professor. He's smart, but he's forgetful. He lives in the past but prefers the future. He knows what he's doing, but he doesn't always pay attention. He always has a solution, but they don't always work to his advantage. In short, he's the perfect mix of a character that keeps him from being a stuffy old man or an annoying idiot. The voice actor for him is perfect as well. I don't see a celebrity in a recording booth, I hear an actual character who's having fun. The design is simple but unique, with a blue pointy hat and a long white beard, which is typically what people think of when they think wizards. With all these things, Disney has created a perfect three-dimensional character that entertains, teaches, and is really fun to watch.Several other characters are brilliantly done as well. There's Archimedes, Merlin's talking intelligent owl, who has a grumpy personality but a heart of gold. He has a lot of great lines and moments throughout the movie, usually of him getting coerced into doing something. Then there's the ""villain"", Mad Madam Mim. Note that I say ""villain"", because she's more of a side character who pops up in the middle of the movie, has a musical number and a fight scene, and is never seen again. She's an old cranky crone, but very energetic and very creative with her magic, as she shows in her song, which she brags is as powerful as Merlin's. The Wizard's Duel between her and Merlin... WOW! This is nearly animated perfection. The slapstick, the timing, the effects, the scaling, is all perfect. I won't DARE give away how it all ends. You need to see it yourself.Besides the characters, there are a few other good things to note. The sketchy animation and backgrounds supervised by Bill Peet people either love or hate. I think it fits and makes a lot of the movie looks like an illustration in an old book, which looks great. The songs are all memorable, from the introduction song to ""Higitus Figitus"" to ""Mad Madam Mim"" and others, they're creative with the bouncy beat we usually associate with Disney. Though the movie does show the financial difficulties Disney was going through at the time, they did great with what they had, better than the next few movies that would come out of the Disney Dark Ages...So this sounds like a great movie. What's the problem? ...Well, the main problems, sadly, are with the story and the other characters. Notice that I didn't list Arthur in the Great Characters part. He doesn't have much of a personality, just serving as the ""everyman"", the student to learn a lesson and to share the audience's amazement of Merlin's magic. Not exactly boring, but with being the main focus of the story and in contrast to Merlin's 3D character, he's a disappointment. His closed-minded guardians named Sir Ector and Sir Kay are even more boring, with their only thing of note that they believe in strict discipline and the old ways. They show up, there's a short conflict, then they leave. They have basically nothing else to do with the movie but create short bouts of ""reality.""The story, I'm sorry to say, is very disjointed. Most of the movie focuses on Merlin's lessons and the adventures he takes Arthur on. I keep forgetting that the land has no king, that they're going to hold a tournament to decide, and YES, even the Sword in the Stone, what the movie is named for, only appears at the beginning and end! Additionally, all the lessons that Merlin teaches Arthur to be a good king, they're never brought up again. There's nothing showing Arthur putting them to use, mentioning them, or any situation that might require them. The movie is basically ""have an adventure, teach a lesson, 5 minutes of plot, repeat."" The ending, without giving anything away, just ends. No resolution, no ""what next"", it just runs out of time and leaves the rest to draw your own conclusions.In conclusion, this movie is REALLY FUN, one of Disney's best. However, they put nearly all their focus and creativity into Merlin and his world and left the rest of the movie to run on autopilot. If they had made Arthur as interesting and fleshed-out as Merlin and given more meaning to the lessons, this might have been a fantastic movie. As is, the movie is still great to watch, both for young and old. It's a Disney classic, and I thoroughly enjoy it."
39,The Sword in the Stone,,14 October 2013,ever green,"nice, didactic, amusing, touching. a classical Disney respecting the old recipes.it is not a surprise or one of great animation but after years and many meetings it remains fresh. and this is important. the mixture between humor and lessons , the first image of king Arthur for kids, the splendid Archimedes and so childish-wise Merlin are the best food for soul and imagination. a beautiful adventure - that is its virtue. and not an ordinary one but a delicate definition of miracles, danger, victories and traps. and few scenes remains remarkable far from every fashion. for many it can be seed of memories or a rediscover of a different manner to create the spell of animation. for other - a part of life, when this movie was inspiration for a large and amazing personal world."
40,The Sword in the Stone,10,7 March 2011,One Of Disney's Best Classics And One Of My personal Favorites,"this is one of my very favorite animated features from Disney's classic library and archives. when i was a kid it was one of my very favorite of all and i think i appreciate it more now then i did way back then. there is so much sophistication and intelligent wit in the dialog and conception that it can hardly be fully appreciated by a kid.this definitely has one of the best screenplays and dialog of all the Disney classics. even though it has beautiful, classic hand drawn animation and some wonderful visuals, it is more dialog and screenplay reliant than most Disney hand drawn animated feature films of the past or present for that matter.one of the things i love best about Disney animated features from the 1960's, is their emphasis on character animation. the human animation of Merlin, Wart, sir hector and Kay is incredibly nuanced and believable with lots of attention payed to movements and performance. the animation of Archimedes and the villainous Mim is some of Disney's most engaging and cutest.in fact this is one of Disney's warmest, cutest and most engaging films. Disney also does this like no one else, Disney films always emphasize cozy cuteness and ooky poo cuddly values, but strangely they emerge from it unscathed. icky baby adorable cuteness can pretty much kill a movie and make it unwatchable for anyone older than the 'Barney', 'Yo Gabba' age group. not so with Disney films usually. they often handle the sentimental, cuddly cuteness so well that you hardly think about how cozy and snuggly the films are until afterwards. nothing hardly ever seems saccharine or forced, especially with the older Disney classics.cuteness aside, this is also a very sophisticated cartoon with some great dialog and dry, intelligent, adult wit. there are so many great lines of dialog here you can't write em all down in one review. the conversation Archimedes and Merlin have when Merlin tries to teach the Wart history in reverse is hilarious and classic. ""you can't let the boy go around telling people the world is flat"" says Archimedes dryly, ""they'll take him for a lunatic"". there is a classic moment during Merlin's hocus pocus nonsense song where he forgets and asks ""where was i?"", to which the Wart replies, ""uh-hockety pockety?"". so much here is subtle and amusing. the closing line of dialog where Merlin explains the difference between motion pictures and television to Wart is one of the funniest and cleverest closing lines in all of cinema comedy.comic and sentimental, cute and infinitely wise, this film is a real Disney treasure and comic, witty gem."
41,The Sword in the Stone,10,31 July 2006,"And then, there was magic.....","Disney made this animated film in 1963. ""The Sword in the Stone"" is an animated film based loosely on the King Arthur tale. We all know about the sword Excalibur and how King Arthur was able to get it out. This movie pretty much shows it in exactly this way, but with more Disney fun!I've never seen this before, although I've seen the end of it on the Old Disney Channel back in 1997. Yeah, it looked good, but note the modern flair this movie had: after the door was shut, Merlin mentioned about how great movies are - like television, but without any commercials!!!!! Don't get me wrong; I remembered that part!But still, this should be worth watching somehow.""The Sword in the Stone"" is great Disney fare for everyone.10/10"
42,The Sword in the Stone,10,14 June 1999,My favorite!,"This is my favorite Disney animated feature film(followed by Hurcules). If you haven't seen it, you are a fool. It is great and something about it is really good. I like that owl, ummmm...achemides. And that song-- higgitus figgitus biggitus mum, preste digittarium! Ha Ha Ha!"
43,The Sword in the Stone,6,9 January 2018,An Insipid Medieval Disney Picture,"By the 1960's, the animation industry had sharply declined due to increased production costs and changing technology. Walt had become less involved with animation when he started Disneyland and television. THE SWORD IN THE STONE, released in 1963, has never been held in high regard by Disney fans, but has never been disliked either.I've always found THE SWORD IN THE STONE to be an anomaly in the Disney canon, because it was released between two features with strong and engaging storytelling and the fact that one of Disney's best storymen, Bill Peet handled it single handedly. Yet the story feels underwhelming as there isn't very much action nor is there conflict with a build up to the climax. Another issue is the heavy amount of reused animation, most of it from the film itself; Several animation cycles are repeated throughout the film. This also cheapens the artistic value of an already insipid film. Director Wolfgang Reitherman was known for doing this as a director and was criticized by his colleagues and fans for this. The stylized designs that worked so effectively in 101 DALMATIANS don't really lend itself to a medieval setting nor does the jazzy musical score. One key element to a great Disney picture is great characters and they're here. Merlin and Archimedes are cantankerous and funny. Sir Ector and Sir Kay are obnoxious antagonists (though not true villains), but are also funny as well. When you really think about it, Arthur's situation with Ector and Kay is basically the same as in CINDERELLA.The storyline is mostly Merlin attempting to educate a young Arthur by transforming him into various animals. Despite the shortcomings of telling an engaging story, the viewer does come away with an appreciation for education and philosophy. It can be argued that despite Merlin's (short sighted) ability to see into the future, his attempts to educate Arthur nearly prevent him from being anointed king, which is something Merlin had no foresight on.Although not one of the Disney greats, this should belong in the library of any true Disney connoisseur."
44,The Sword in the Stone,7,6 September 2017,Arthur the Kid,"This is a decent presentation of the early chapters of ""The Once and Future King."" In it, we have the scrawny Arthur, making his way through life with little hope. Of course, the title comes from the legend that a sword had been put into a stone and the kingdom will be given to the one who can remove it. Naturally, all the knights with their broad torsos take a crack at it, to no avail. One day, Arthur accidentally comes across the titled sword, reaches over, grabs it, and pulls it out like it was stuck in a lump of butter. This brings about a great uproar and a need to grow up quickly. He has some sidekicks and there are some lightweight events that happen. It's fun and wacky and follows the legend....somewhat."
45,The Sword in the Stone,,29 August 2016,Its good to be the king,"My favorite version of the legend about a boy destined to be king and meets a man who changes his life forever when he pulls out the sword.It covers his home life as an orphan, his training with Merlin and being crowned. The humor is situation comedy from turning the boy into a fish and nearly getting eaten by sharks or a wild following them keeps getting hurt three stogies style. Archimedes (an owl with a mind of his own) is witty, clever and has courage when it counts for his friends.What makes this a classic is the subtle hints to come with a squirm taking interest in Wart (King Arthur) and he breaks her heart like he will Gweniver someday or when Merlin says Tahiti will be a popular tourist destination in the future.The songs are catchy times that stay in your head for days like this is what makes the world go round and the sword in the stone.The medieval setting seems a little inaccurate since London won't be found for another thousand years or in door plumbing for that matter. The art drawings weren't the best during the crowd scenes and forest scenery like other Disney classics. Its very noticeable at how laughably bad it can get.Still I find the plot, characters and music over comes the flaws."
46,The Sword in the Stone,7,24 February 2015,Whimsical fun with a basic plot.,"This is an animated film from the Walt Disney era, one about young Arthur, who aspires to be a knight's squire. However, a powerful but forgetful wizard named Merlin has plans for Arthur to be something beyond a squire.This movie actually starts off with a captivating intro where England is left without a king, and a proclamation has been sent that the one who can pull the sword out of the stone will be made king. It then leads to imaginative and quirky scenes where Merlin demonstrates his magical powers to Arthur while, at the same time, try to get him an education so he could get to places beyond that of being a squire.This film really does not have much of a plot, as most of the movie is about Merlin showing Arthur his magic spells (I thought the squirrel scene took up too much time). However, it's great imaginative fun for the little kids and, probably to the adults' liking, you can get a couple of important messages from the film like getting an education and how complicated love can get.The animation was pretty good, not as vibrant as earlier films or in later films of the 80s and 90s, but it is serviceable. The songs by the Sherman Brothers weren't my favorite to listen to, but they're quite fun and easy to sing along with (again, something good for the kids). Wolfgang Reitherman did a nice job directing, as the characters were memorable and have a nice dose of humor, and his sons, Richard and Robert, did a nice job in voicing Arthur - innocent and carefree, but grounded. Rickie Sorensen also voiced Arthur and also did an equally good job.Overall, it's not one of the best Disney movies I've seen but it does have a certain charm to it that definitely acquires that special ""Disney touch."" Perhaps that is what separates the more classic Disney movies from the more recent ones - the classics, and some of the ones filmed later in the 1980s and 1990s, have a more whimsical and charming element, while the more recent ones have a more hip and modern Hollywood influence. I myself prefer a Disney film with a more classic feel.Grade B-"
47,The Sword in the Stone,6,8 February 2015,Good but could have been better,"The Sword in the Stone was the last Disney animated feature that Walt saw released. Surprisingly, the story execution is much weaker and not as interesting as the films that preceded it. It does have great characters though. Merlin and Ector were my favorites. Sebastian Cabot gave a great performance as Ector. I wonder if they originally had J. Pat Omalley in mind for Ector, since he sounds like some of the other characters that he voiced. Kay was also an amusing antagonist. The problem with the story is that nothing really interesting happens. Another fault with the film is that it heavily reuses the same animation cycles that were made for the movie, often several times in the same scene. While not as strong as some of the earlier films, Sword in the Stone does offer some great characters."
48,The Sword in the Stone,7,14 January 2015,thin story and uncompelling kid Arthur,The king has died and no one can agree on the right king for England. A miraculous sword appear in London stuck in an anvil and stone. It comes with an inscription proclaiming the man who pulls the sword will be the new king. Many try but nobody succeeds. The Sword in the Stone becomes forgotten as the land fall into a dark age. Merlin the wizard has plans for the young orphan Arthur.The animation is classic hand-drawn style. It has an old-style charm that is reminiscent of TV cartoons of that era. It's educational at times. It's pretty light weight humor. The story is pretty thin. It doesn't put in enough time for a compelling villain. It also suffer for not having a beautiful princess or an interesting lead. Arthur is too flimsy to be a compelling child character. Merlin and Archimedes are really the only fascinating characters. It's also missing any great songs. The best part of the movie is the transformational battle between Merlin and Mim.
49,The Sword in the Stone,7,23 September 2014,Underrated animated Disney film,"This is a underrated animated Disney film, that I can get why it might be underrated. But I personally think it deserved a bit more recognition for it's worth. The story is about the building up of Arthur by getting trained by Merlin to take the crown and become King Arthur. And most of the training parts are actually fun to watch. My personal favorite was when they transform into squirrels and gets hit on by the female squirrels. The animation in this sort of reminded me of the animation for Winnie the Pooh. This isn't topnotch when it comes to the animation compared to other Disney films, but it gets the job done.7.8/10"
50,The Sword in the Stone,7,1 September 2014,Classic Disney,"Tired of living in a Medieval mess... Merlin uses all his magic powers to change a scrawny little boy into a legendary hero! When you think of strong Disney films, this may not immediately come to mind, but it should. While people tend to either think of the classics (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Bambi) or the early 90s revival (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin), this is every bit as good with an entertaining story and lots of fun, with good animation, too.The most memorable part is with Madam Mim, and it is not surprising that Disney has used her in other cartoons, and even put her in their ""Kingdom Hearts"" video game. She is a great villain, especially given that she is most kooky than evil.The moral of the story is somewhat obscure. Early on, we are lead to believe that the importance of education would play a big role in Arthur's success. Merlin makes education out to be the most important thing. But as the film progresses, we see more time is spent turning into different animals (fish, bird, squirrel) than actually learning.Apparently this is one of the few Disney films of its era without a sequel or platinum DVD. Why? If there is someway to put together a handful of special features, this ought to be seen by more people and respected as a historic treasure."
51,The Sword in the Stone,8,31 October 2013,Disney's most underrated effort,"The Sword In The Stone is a personal favourite of all the Disney animated films. It has a number of things that make it feel rather unique including the laid back tone, lack of a true villain and how it mainly teaches lessons about life. It is certainly one of Disney's most interesting and enjoyable films.The plot loosely follows the book of the same name, Arthur (mainly known as Wart)is a boy who aims to be a knight's squire. When out hunting he falls through the roof of Merlin, a brilliant but slightly eccentric wizard and his highly educated owl Archimedes. Merlin knows that Arthur has the potential for brilliance and decides to give him an education so he can achieve anything. Along the way they change into a variety of animals, meet the menacing witch Madam Mim and learn a lot about life. The story does have a very warm and inviting feel to it. It is an intelligent film presented in a fun way which lets you learn as well as be entertained, it doesn't try to tone down smart aspects and that helps it to stand out. The characters are all brilliant which is crucial as it makes the film work. Arthur is a likable, naïve boy who we know will learn from his experiences to become king. However it was distracting how three different people did his voice, which explains why it changes frequently and it can be pretty annoying. Merlin is a wonderful lead for Arthur, his dissatisfaction with the times and frustrations with Arthur are very funny as he's nicely voiced by Karl Swenson. Talking owl Archimedes is brilliant too, his reactions to events and grouchy outbursts are hilarious, and he also offers a good link between Merlin's weirdness and the real world. Mim is great as she offers the closest thing to a villain, making a good impression in her short screen time. The brash Ector and arrogant Kay are great support as Arthur's adoptive family. The animation is stellar as always, the 60s saw some really good looking animation. It is relatively simple, but it does feel very authentic and it fits in perfectly. The views presented of the castle and forests really do bring an authentic as well as nicely atmospheric feel. The film is certainly the most philosophical of all the Disney film which adds to its individuality, it's nice that it focuses on the trials of life rather than jump into all the action which can be a flaw of many Disney films. When the scenes of adventure do come along they are all the more effective. The adventures as fish and squirrels are really enjoyable, filled with excitement and suspense as well as plenty of laughs. The climactic battle between Merlin and Mim is just fantastic, they turn into different animals and duel which leads to some great action and animation. The climax involving Excalibur is also well set up and nicely uplifting. Disney's songs can be a bit boring, but here they are excellent, songs such as ""Higitus Figitus"" are really catchy and great fun. One of the few complains is the wish for it to have been longer, but given the time it was released it is understandable. One of Disney's stronger and more underrated efforts, it is a brilliantly enjoyable feature."
52,The Sword in the Stone,5,6 August 2013,Kid-friendly King Arthur tale,"A young orphan named ""Wart"" wants nothing more than to be the squire to his older foster brother. Merlin the Magician sees more potential in the boy and begins training him for a greater destiny. ""Wart"" accompanies his brother to a tournament in London, where he will discover his true fate as Merlin's visions of greatness unfold.We all know how it feels when you remember a movie one way from childhood and realize as an adult it's not quite as it seemed. That was my feeling as I watched Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone."" Far be it for me to start slinging mud at what is considered to be a classic in the eyes of many. However, it became tedious watching Merlin the Magician teach ""Wart"" life lessons through turning himself and the boy into one animal after another and breaking into song.I've never been a big fan of any musicals. I'm sure this factor has everything to do with my lack of enthusiasm for ""The Sword in the Stone."" My preferred version of the Arthur story would lean more towards the adventurous ""Excalibur."" ""The Sword in the Stone"" does contain quite a bit of magic. Some people with certain religious convictions will find this a good reason to steer clear of the movie. I would have to say that anyone who watches ""The Lord of the Rings"" films has no right to throw rocks at this one.My 7-year old loved ""The Sword in the Stone,"" so maybe I've just outgrown it. He's watched it twice already, where I found it near impossible to sit through once. If children like it, does it really matter what this old reviewer thinks about it anyway? It's been proved time and time again that Disney movies are critic-proof."
53,The Sword in the Stone,10,20 July 2005,Great one!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
54,The Sword in the Stone,7,28 March 2004,Nice Disney elements,"'The Sword in the Stone' is a nice animation movie from Disney which contains all the nice Disney elements but it lacks a real story. In fact, there is no story at all. The movie is filled with little episodes that are fun to watch but have not much to do with the actual story that must be about Merlin the wizard (voice by Karl Swenson) and how he educates the boy named Arthur (voice by Rickie Sorensen), who will be King Arthur one day. The way Disney presents the story here I think it could be told in ten minutes or less.Still, I enjoyed the movie enough. Although it is probably one of the weakest Disney movies I have seen it has its great moments. There are sequences where Merlin changes himself and Arthur into animals and although they plat a little predictable they are pretty funny as well. One of the problems is that these sequences play on forever until it is not funny anymore. There are little lessons for Arthur here but we see it simply because otherwise the movie would be too short.There is a good chance you will be disappointed. Compared to the very early Disney animated features this could be called bad. If you don't expect too much there is a good chance you will love some of the moments, and at least the animation itself which is great once again. There is a sequence with squirrels and I think that would have made a great animated short movie on its own. That is what 'The Sword in the Stone' basically is, a couple of good and nice short movies played back to back."
55,The Sword in the Stone,7,4 April 2011,Dinsey classics are always great!,"While I love the Disney classics so much, of course there are a few which may not meet the standards completely. By this, I mean, their story.It's hard to explain with this one. It did have a lot of content, but not much of a story. To be honest, it was better that way. However, I still felt that it could have gone another hour or so.But for the lack of story, it did have a lot of content, some of which, including the fish (water), squirrel (land) and bird (sky) scenes that I laughed at, as well as the sword in the stone scenes.I rate this 7/10 mostly because it could have had more story in it. At least 30 minutes more, since it got my attention and I wanted to see more interaction with the magic.I loved the good guy vs badguy scene though. That was really clever and funny!"
56,The Sword in the Stone,7,7 March 2009,"THE SWORD IN THE STONE (Wolfgang Reitherman, 1963) ***","Though well done in itself, this does not often figure among the Walt Disney Studios' most beloved animated features. Even so, the film had a sort of follow-up  by likewise treading the ""Merrie Old England"" vein  in the even more maligned ROBIN HOOD (1973), but which I fondly remember from my childhood; for what it is worth, the same was true of the recently-viewed (and reasonably entertaining) THE ARISTOCATS (1970), generally deemed a pale shadow of earlier anthropomorphic animated Disney fare! To be fair, THE SWORD IN THE STONE's attempts to explain the subsequent mythic qualities of King Arthur  by having him as a scrawny wannabe squire embarking on a magical journey of self-discovery under the tutelage of the lovably eccentric Merlin (and his grumpy owl-pal Archimedes)  tend to get lost in rather irrelevant, sometimes overly-cute, and altogether derivative set-pieces (its disparate borrowings ranging from FANTASIA [1940] to BAMBI [1942] and SLEEPING BEAUTY [1959]!). That said, the ""Duel Of Wizards"" is certainly inventively handled; interestingly enough, a live-action variant of this was seen contemporaneously in the Roger Corman-directed spoof adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's THE RAVEN (1963)! While not as charming in the long run as previous Disney fables (with the Sherman Bros.' songs being pleasant but hardly memorable), or as striking a portrait of the Middle Ages as it could have been (considering that its source was T.H. White's celebrated book ""The Once And Future King""), THE SWORD IN THE STONE is nonetheless colorful and engaging fare, keeping one solidly entertained throughout its 79-minute duration (which brevity and target audience, then, necessitated the resulting streamlining/over-simplification)."
57,The Sword in the Stone,,10 September 2000,Good,"Disney`s ""The sword in the stone"" is based on the legend of Arthur and the sword in the stone.The drawings are as always good in this Disney-film, but it isn`t my favorite Disney-film.  It has good atmosphere, good music and plenty of magic to keep your interest, and the movie is definitely worth seeing at least once if you are a Disney-fan. 8/10"
58,The Sword in the Stone,8,12 November 2013,Disney duel,"50 year has passed since this movie came out.It really shows it's age.Anyway I seen worse Disney classics.A boy finds a magical sword and meets the wizard Merlin.In the climax Merlin and a witch fights each other.An unusual fight with transformed critters and a dragon.It's a playful and colorful movie that seems to spoof Disney itself.The cuteness kills the movie.But the songs are memorable and lively.There are romance, animal antics and a duel.So what's not to love? 8/10"
59,The Sword in the Stone,10,11 August 2012,The Sword in the Stone That Will Destine One For The Throne.,"I remember seeing this among other Disney films I saw in elementary school (at least part of them anyway) and those that aired on non-cable t.v. Some years later, I viewed this on Youtube a while back and for some time afterward, I'd been considering and wanting to buy a copy of the 45th Anniversary edition of it. I finally did last month and it's great seeing it once again. I never really thought or paid attention to it as much as some, certain other Disney animated features, but now I think I have to concur that it's one of the more underrated ones. A boy named Arthur (a.k.a. Wart) has the dream of one day becoming a squire. But little does he know that he's destined for something much greater, which is being the new English king, which is the position he takes over later from his late father (although being new at this and not knowing much about a ruler's duties, Wart isn't so sure he's up to it). This occurs once he successfully pulls out the enchanted sword from the stone. That makes sense, considering he's his son and he eventually inherits his place on the throne. But before that, while going off to retrieve another sword in the woods for his foster brother Kay, he comes across a cottage where he meets the grand wizard, Merlin, and his highly intellectual owl, Archimedes. Merlin appoints himself as Wart's tutor and emphasizes brains used as associated with an education being more important than brawn. This movie has a lot of thrilling moments, such as Wart getting a feel of what it's like to be different animals through the help of Merlin's magic, Merlin's talks about what are yet to come from his time travels (which leaves anyone from his time he tries to explain to about them puzzled or perplexed) and what's one of the most renowned moments, if not the most renowned moment, the Wizard's Duel between Merlin and the witch Mad Madam Mim. I never read the initial source that inspired Disney's take, but I read a little there was mentioned about it in the difference between this and T.H. White's book, which is this version being more comical. Aside from the fact that again I never read the original source, I don't mind nor do I think I would even if I did. I recommend this to anyone who's into adventure. Because it has plenty of it, making it still outstanding nonetheless of other things."
60,The Sword in the Stone,,28 July 2011,My favorite Disney film!,"I don't know exactly why many people don't praise this movie more. I absolutely love this film. There are not many songs in the movie but the ones that are in it are enjoyable.Merlin who is a wizard that can see centuries into the future and lives with his annoying but lovable owl Archimedes predicts that a young boy of around 11 or 12 will drop into his house and sure enough he's dead on. Merlin takes the young Wart who is the future King of England, on many adventures and tries to teach Wart that knowledge is power.Somewhere along the way Wart is appointed to be Kay's squire at a jousting competition. Merlin is upset by this and says ""Blow me to Bermuda!"" Merlin takes off and Wart and Archimedes are left alone. Here is where we find that Wart goes to pull out the sword in the stone because he forgot Kay's sword. He tells Sir Ector that he got the sword from the stone yet nobody believes him at first but they go back and find that he was really the one who pulled it and is therefore dubbed King Arthur, King of all England.I love the wizard's duel between Merlin and the evil Madam Mim. One of the best parts of the movie. And also the part where Merlin is being chased by the fat girl squirrel who takes a fancy to him. Love this film!"
61,The Sword in the Stone,9,13 January 2010,Truly Awesome Animated Classic,"I used to catch this randomly on television as a kid and I was always very excited when I was lucky enough to catch it. I never really knew what it was, but I remember absolutely loving it.The Sword in the Stone story is really great and this animated one intended for kids is fantastic. Wart is a great character, as he is naïve, yet willing to explore what Merlin has to teach him.There are two scenes that I vividly recall loving as a child. The first is the scene where Wart and Merlin turn into squirrels and run around the trees. I have always loved squirrels and always thought that looked like a fun time.Second, I loved the wizards duel. I thought it was brilliant how Merlin turned into a germ to beat the seemingly invincible dragon.Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone"" is an awesome animated tale that is unfortunately looked over. It's a gem of a kid's movie."
62,The Sword in the Stone,10,9 April 2008,Forever Endearing,"This original Disney Classic has captured the hearts of millions throughout the decades.Generation upon generation has enjoyed it's forever endearing vibe that continues to offer warm hearted laughs and wholesome family fun.Merlin the Wizard is truly a masterpiece of comic relief! I really don't think Disney has produced a funnier Character since. He often has trouble with his over-grown beard and his pet owl, ""Arcamedies""... is always in a rather hateful mood!I think ""Sword in the Stone"" should go down in history as one of the BEST animated Disney Movies ever. It's just a Classic! No one can argue with that. The Disney movies being produced these days are.. I hate to say it... but they are boring and *very* over-rated. They offer too much technology and not enough heart.I also think every parent should consider adding ""Sword in the Stone"" to their child's video collection. Its good, clean fun that will keep your child entertained every time you pop it in.Go out and buy/rent it today!!!"
63,The Sword in the Stone,10,13 October 2007,A Favorite literary Disney Classic,"This film is one of my favorite ""Disney Classics"" from my childhood. I have even read the original book by T.H. White. I am a literary woman, and I do have a gimmick for movies and also TV series that are based on books.I love when Wart/Arthur and Merlin the Wizard become squirrels; it was so cute! I also love the scene where Arthur pulled the sword from the stone that is in the churchyard and becomes King Arthur! thus the legend is born. So anyway, I will always love The Sword in the Stone. It is an great movie with interesting characters and great animation too."
64,The Sword in the Stone,8,5 November 2003,A childhood classic,"This Disney film, along with Robin Hood, is one of my fondest movie memories. The animation is masterful and the script is witty. The songs aren't fantastic but the wonderful characters are so vivid and magical that it makes up for it ten-fold.Merlin is a great character, as is his pet owl Archimedes. However, it is with Mad Madame Mim that we find the majority of our laughs. Such a wonderful Disney Villain, more wicked than Hook or Cruella, but funnier than the March Hare. The Wizard's duel at the end of the film is one of Disney's greatest triumphs.Also, look out for the scene with the squirrels. It's a very funny scene, yet ends with a heart-wrenching goodbye. It's enough to bring tears to your eyes (until you realise that it's just a cartoon!)Well, hats off to Disney on this one. I am biased as I grew up with it, but I am so glad I did. You may not love it like I do, but it really is worth the viewing.Forever a classic!"
65,The Sword in the Stone,5,23 May 2001,New Re-Mastering Needed!,"I recently purchased this movie on DVD because of the fond childhood memories I had of it, and because the DVD packaging mentioned it had been remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 - Boy, was I disappointed!The remastering of the color of this 1963 movie is excellent; however, it does not seem to be available in ""Widescreen"" format, only in ""Fullscreen"".It was the audio quality that truly disappointed me, since the Dolby Digital 5.1 is rather poor, with no use whatsoever of the two back speakers, and should therefore be labeled more as Dolby Digital 2.1.I feel that this is basically a wonderful cartoon that needs an over-haul; in its present form, it is a little on the dull side. That could be changed by using some of today's technology, in animation, sound and special effects, even if it meant tampering a little with the syncronization of the voices, so that the movement of the character's mouths were more in line with today's Disney standards...!Of course, a purist might want to leave it ""as is""..."
66,The Sword in the Stone,5,21 September 2005,The Sword in the Stone,"If you have ever wanted to see the story of young King Arthur pull the sword Excalibur out of the stone, this is quite an interesting idea of what it was like. Well, mainly focusing on his adventures before the sword, and then becoming King. Basically Merlin the Wizard and Archimedes the Owl are expecting someone important, and they are right. They make friends with a young 12 year old boy named Arthur, or 'Wart' to his guardians. Basically the rest of the film, apart from near the end obviously is Arthur and Merlin turning into animals and having adventures, e.g. battling big sharp-teethed fish, having squirrels fall in love and flying as a bird. It's only near the end that Arthur comes across the once attempted sword and pulls it out, after so many people trying, so this means he is King. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for George Bruns. Worth watching!"
67,The Sword in the Stone,,19 September 2002,"Good, but not quite","I like this Disney movie very much.  But there sems to be something missing. It didn't seem to be as good as the rest of the Disney films were.  I don't know.  I mean there are some great scenes, and funny line, but something is missing."
68,The Sword in the Stone,8,30 April 2016,Disney should be ashamed for not promoting this more,"As the final completely animated movie produced before the death of Walt E. Disney himself, this was a truly grand conclusion to the Golden Age of Disney's animated films. The humor works, the charm is captivating, and the duel between Merlin and Mim is made in a way that despite how it doesn't have the serious action, it can constantly entertain with the different animals they transform into, in a cartoony manner. I also didn't notice errors in the narrative like several more official critics did, and even if I did notice, the humor would make up for it. I did take unfavorable notice of Merlin's ability of foresight, as they snuck some 1963-era references into a film set in the 5th century (this is around the time Arthur was crowned King of Britain), including the historical spoiler that King Arthur's experience would be made into books and movies. Give it a watch and see for yourself that this film is under-appreciated and overlooked."
69,The Sword in the Stone,6,7 February 2015,Enjoyable but certainly not among the top tier of the Disney animated films.,"""The Sword in the Stone"" is a film that most children will enjoy. However, if you were to ask 100 random kids what their favorite Disney cartoons were, I would probably have a heart attack if even a single kid said ""The Sword in the Stone"". It's enjoyable enough to watch--but also lacks anything endearing that would make it truly memorable. While there's really nothing to hate about the film, there really isn't a lot that stands out either. The animation is 1960s style Disney-- which means a rougher style due to cost-cutting measures. Instead of huge armies of animators, many were fired and the use of Xerox machine was introduced. It saved money but also gave the films a slightly rougher look. The music is also enjoyable but nothing in it is memorable. And as for the story, it's nice...and nice is a term you don't use with a film that is a classic. Overall, worth seeing but nothing more."
70,The Sword in the Stone,9,24 October 2014,A Magical Movie,"This is one of Disney's best magical movies. If you love the Arthurian Legend and any of the other Disney film animations then The Sword in the Stone you should enjoy. It is a very comical twist on the tale of Arthur, the boy to become King, with some memorable magical moments by Merlin the Magician.If you like films like: ""First Knight"", ""Excalibur"", or ""Camelot"" then you may find The Sword in the Stone appealing.If you like magical Disney films like ""The Black Cauldron"", ""Fantasia"", ""Cinderella"" or even ""Pete's Dragon"" then you might like The Sword in the Stone.9/10"
71,The Sword in the Stone,9,11 December 2009,A Different Side of Disney,"I distinctly recall this as the favorite film of my early childhood. Whenever we went on a trip, this was the movie I brought for the car ride (much to other passengers' chagrin). Looking back now, it seems odd, what with the lesser quality animation and sloppy voiceovers on the main character (not to mention the lack of princesses!). But even with all the faux pas that I normally rake animated films over the coals for, there's just something about this movie that is sincerely endearing beyond the limitations of reason.First off, the comedy is unparalleled. No snarky jokes or one-ups, no pop culture reliance, no BATHROOM HUMOR. Just a masterful blend of character, situations and wordplay. Yet at the same time, a level of poignancy is attained that just tweaks your heart at the right moment. I would say that the squirrel sequence is one of the best executed scenes in animated history. Interestingly, this film also houses one of the best studies of character animation: the wizard's duel where Merlin and Mim change into a variety of creatures without losing their essential defining traits.The lessons of this story are also wonderfully unique in the Disney canon. There is no singular overarching villain that our hero overcomes. Rather Arthur learns to shape his own character and take command of destiny. It is not battles that define the hero, but his ability to take insight from the world around him and apply it to his own growth.I can see the reasons why this film often gets overshadowed by showier works like Little Mermaid, but I also see the wonders that await once you give it a chance. Sword and the Stone offers a different kind of Disney that is both refreshing and a comfort to watch.Quote of the Film:-I am not a boy, I'm a squirre-, I mean I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy, no, I'm... I'm an old man!"
72,The Sword in the Stone,5,18 January 2007,King Arthur has always come and gone throughout movie history.  I envision remaking this with characters from '60s TV shows.,"""The Sword in the Stone"" is mostly entertaining just for some of the gags that Merlin plays (I still think that the Wizard Blizzard was pretty neat). Otherwise, it is a Disney movie; why do the learned scientific types always have to be so absent-minded? It's hard for me to think about the King Arthur legend without thinking of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". But overall, I think that the movie isn't hurting anything.I actually have envisioned a version of this movie with characters from '60s TV shows. Jeannie (""I Dream of Jeannie"") is Merlin; Maj. Nelson (""IDOJ"") is Arthur; Samantha (""Bewitched"") is Archimedes; Dr. Bellows (""IDOJ"") is Sir Ector; Darrin (""Bewitched"") and Maj. Healey (""IDOJ"") are both Kay; Amanda Bellows (""IDOJ"") is the scullery maid; and Gen. Peterson (""IDOJ"") is Pelinore. Characters from ""Gilligan's Island"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Batman"" and ""The Flying Nun"" could probably appear somewhere.Bermuda. How'd he get there without disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle?"
73,The Sword in the Stone,10,25 December 2006,This movie is Disney magic at its best!,"In medieval England, a magic wizard named Merlin meets up with a scrawny young boy named Arthur, who has been nicknamed Wart by his family. Merlin knows that the boy has a great future ahead of him, so he starts schooling the boy. He is turned into a fish, a squirrel, and a bird to learn about what life is like for them. He later meets Merlin's enemy, a ugly old witch named Madame Mim, and watches Merlin beat Mim in a wizard's duel. While at a jousting tournament, Arthur notices that a sword has been embedded in a stone. When he pulls it out, he learns that it is a magic sword and that whoever pulls it out would be named King of England.The legend of King Arthur has been retold many times, and Disney's animated musical THE SWORD IN THE STONE is one of the best. The Sherman Brothers have provided excellent musical scores for many Disney films, and this is one of their best. The ""wizard's duel"" between Merlin and Madame Mim is one of Disney's most memorable scenes. This magical film is fun for families everywhere! 10/10."
74,The Sword in the Stone,,24 August 2006,"Despite A Rather Poor Story Structure, ""The Sword in the Stone"" has a lot of ups and downs","Let's go back to the early 1960s. The last time Walt Disney tried to be ambitious was with 1959's ""Sleeping Beauty"", and that film was a big budgeted misfire that was popular, but it couldn't recoup the insanely high production costs. Walt Disney was shattered once again like he was when World War II brought the studio to its knees. Disney began losing interest in animation, and after a disastrous pitch for ""Chanticleer"" (which was supposed to be the next Disney animated film), Disney was ready to dump it for good. Instead, a quickly-produced adaptation of T.H. White's ""The Sword in the Stone"" was put into production.This time, one director (Wolfgang Rietherman) handled the film and it was produced for a cheap amount of money. The Xerography used for the previous film, ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", was used once again despite the fact that Walt hated it. This was not a film that the Disney team had a lot of fun with, and one can easily tell.The story is a hodgepodge, it's just a bunch of episodes of Merlin teaching some lessons to the young King Arthur. They're loosely strung together and it's inconsistent. The story is shallow, and it's ending comes out of nowhere. It does all it can to wade through 79 minutes of film. Fortunately, the film is entertaining. The characters are likable and endearing. There's a spectacular scene where Merlin and the villainous Mad Madam Mim engage in a Wizard's Duel. There are funny bits like a Wile E. Coyote-style wolf trying to eat Arthur and failing miserably at it. A scene where Merlin and Arthur turn into fish is amusing, along with a scene where they are squirrels.The songs are alright as well. ""That's What Make's The World Go 'Round"" is probably the centerpiece, while ""Higgitus Figgitus"" is a real delight. Madam Mim's song is not as great, unfortunately. The opening song is also worthy. So far, there's a weak story, entertaining moments, and good songs. What else? The animation. While it's not bad, the Xerox style does not suit the medieval setting. It fit ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians""' modern setting very well, but here, not so well.""The Sword in the Stone"" is not a bad film, but it has a weak story but it's saved by strong moments, a great soundtrack, endearing characters and it's overall sense of fun. It's one of the more ""fun to watch"" Disney films, but it's not serious masterpiece. Disney never really had confidence in the film after its tepid box office performance, and it was one of the first Disney films on home video at a time when they were starting to roll out the serious classics for the first time. They still re-issue the film on home video formats, because it somewhat sells well. Overall, not bad but not great. Entertaining, though.An 8.5 out of 10."
75,The Sword in the Stone,9,16 March 2006,A great cartoon version of the story about how Arthur became the king of England.,"Disney's version of how the young Arthur could become the king of England might not have any real plot, since it's based on different adventures of Arthur and Merlin. But many different cute adventures make a really cute movie, and the formula sure works for me.When the king of England (probably Arthur's father Uther) dies, there's no one to inherit his thrown. But there's a sword in a stone in a churchyard in London, and the one, who can pull the sword out of the stone, is the right heir to the king's thrown and the next king of England. But though many men try, no one is able to pull the sword out of the stone. The sword in the stone is forgotten, and England has to do without a king for many years.Meanwhile, the orphan boy Arthur (who's actually the illegitimate son of the late king Uther and the lady Igraine, though that's of course not mentioned in this movie) has been adopted by Sir Ector, a local nobleman, and grows up in Sir Ector's castle. But alas, Sir Ector openly prefers his own son, Kay, over his adoptive son, and Arthur, who's almost always called ""Wart"", is merely the lousiest of the servants in the castle. But when Arthur is about twelve years old, his life takes a turn for the better, when he meets the wizard Merlin and his owl Archimedes. Merlin knows that Arthur will become something special one day, so he starts giving him an education. Sir Ector doesn't like that, but he's too afraid of Merlin's magic to really defy him. During a trip to London, Arthur finally finds out who he is. He discovers the sword in the stone and pulls it out. Amazed by this boy being able to do something so many grown men have failed to do, the people immediately make young Arthur their new king, and Sir Ector and his son Kay regret how badly they have treated ""Wart"". But only being around twelve years old, Arthur needs the wise Merlin beside him to lead the kingdom."
76,The Sword in the Stone,8,17 September 2005,Fantastically high-brow and drastically underrated Disney film!,"One of the most imaginative of Disney's animated films and most likely, unfortunately, one of the least known. There is little doubt in my mind, though, that Disney does not get much better than this. The Sword in the Stone is sheer unadulterated good old fashioned cartoon banter. Before criticising this under-watched, perfectly drawn piece of Disney magic, I would advise interested parties to refer to the classic books by T.H.White, and THEN attempt to accuse the film of being low-brow...if you can. To and fro, stop and go, that's what makes the world go round! Profound lyrics, no? Give it a go, watch it, and if you don't like it - ""Quiet Archimedes or I'll turn ye into a human!!"""
77,The Sword in the Stone,,21 July 2005,Some memorable parts (surprisingly poorly brought here),"There's very little story, and this young boy is an uninteresting one, which he should not be when you think about it. The usage of what some (not me, mind you, Christian conservatives) would call ""Jesus light"" looks a tad ridiculous. Nevertheless, the film is occasionally amusing (if just a bit repetitive), and the animation is somewhat of a sight.The post-metamorphosis sequences are the greatest ones. As a fish this kid is much more enjoyable than as a boy. The animal characters have much more... character than the humans; just look at the fat-as-- uh, beaver-like squirrel or the pike (was it?). The most famous scene, the duel, is a good one, likewise, and the ""magical"" sequences are that indeed. Call me a sap, but I am touched by the it'll-never-happen squirrel love story. The best part of the film and bloody poignant stuff!Incidentally, the Finnish translation and - even more so - the dubbing are at times very poor - something unusual for a Disney animation. Especially the songs leave a bland mark. Whether that is the case with the original English version, I do not know (though I will). So actually, never mind that ""incidentally""; this is terribly relevant when it comes to my conception of the film."
78,The Sword in the Stone,9,26 February 2002,A Classic Tale,"The Sword In The Stone is ""Pure Disney Gold""- New York Times. This is a classic tale full of humor and music. Its about the journey of young King Arthur. There are funny characters and a decent plot. Its one of Walt Disney's Best."
79,The Sword in the Stone,10,16 April 2000,My Favorite Disney Flick,"Sword in the Stone is my absolute favorite Disney movie.  It's not as schmaltzy as the other Disney cartoons, mainly because the plot isn't solely about the main characters falling in love.  My favorite scenes include the ""Stop and Go"" song, the fight between Merlin and his rival, and any scene with Archimedes (Merlin's cynical sidekick).  If you want a Disney movie without the typical Disney plot, check this one out."
80,The Sword in the Stone,9,20 March 2002,Best Animated Disney Film,Sword in the Stone is one of the few Disney movies that you will enjoy the older you get. The subtle sarcasm and slight cynicism of Merlin and Archimedes make the film enjoyable for the older audience. Also refreshing is the lack of a love story which often only distorts the story and mushes things up. Enjoyable and catchy songs make this fun for all.
