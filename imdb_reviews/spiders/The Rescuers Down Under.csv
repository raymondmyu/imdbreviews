0,The Rescuers Down Under,10,3 November 2000,Underappreciated Gem,"I have always been one of the, maybe, eight or nine big fans of this movie and I have only one small question about it.WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE MORE LIKE THIS???If you have not seen this movie yet, you must.  It's the first Disney movie to use fully rendered CGI backgrounds throughout and you definately get the sense that the animators wanted to play with this new method.  What I'm getting at is that some of you may want to down some motion sickness medicine first.There are *no* song and dance numbers.  Reason being that this is a surprisingly dark, more emotionally complex story for a Disney movie.  They went out on a limb and chose not to break the tone up too much.This is the number two Lost Disney Movie (number one, without a doubt, is ""the Hunchback of Notre Dame"", which I also love).  It's own creators barely acknowledge its existance.  The very best evidence of this is on the new video release box's plot summary, where a MAJOR character's gender is misidentified.  On the other hand, I sort of enjoy the idea of a ""cult"" Disney movie. Instead of marketing ""Down Under"" to death, Disney can only be accused of the opposite mistake.So, anyway, here I go again running to this movie's defence.  I'll tackle the one major critisism of it before I go.  Many critics were expecting another ""Rescuers"".  In my humble opinion, these two movies are two entirely different animals.  The original ""Rescuers"" is an example of where Disney was in the sixties and seventies.  ""Down Under"" is a time capsule of late eighties, early nineties Disney.  In other words, you can't really say that one is better than the other as the only thing they have in common are three characters (what I'm getting at is that this should be thought of more as ""Rescue Aid Society: the Next Generation"").By the way, I've got an idea that I'm just going to throw out to the proverbial wolves here.  Why not make more ""Rescuers"" movies instead of sequels to Disney movies where follow-up stories make no sence?  They are sitting on one heck of a potential franchise here.  Just thought I'd let you know."
1,The Rescuers Down Under,8,27 February 2009,"Completely likable sequel, that is under-appreciated!","It isn't as good as the immensely charming original, but I enjoyed this very much. You do realise that this was released 13 years after the original, and a lot of the characters had to be animated again. I forgive them for that though, as the animation was surprisingly good, especially the scenes with Marahute, who blew me away at the sight of her. Though Bianca does look different than she was in the original film, she had chubbier cheeks here. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor are great as Bernard and Bianca, although there was a significant change in both characters. John Candy was hilarious as Wilbur. If there is one element that is better than the original, but only marginally, it is that Wilbur is funnier than Orville. The plot was also very good, on a parallel with the original, but that was the intention, and the music by Bruce Broughton was appropriately fitting. Cody is very likable, but sometimes his dialogue is a bit unnatural, and I know that people commented on his accent. George C. Scott, a fine actor, was suitably menacing as McLeach, although his animation at times was a tad frightening. I really enjoyed this movie, it's not perfect, but it is one of the better animated sequels to come out. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
2,The Rescuers Down Under,8,11 November 2007,Charming sequel,"Whilst it's not as good as the original, The Rescuers Down Under is not a disgrace as far as sequels go. Many theatrical sequels tend to be no better than ones released direct-to-video. Down Under is an exception.Plot-wise, there are a few faults. Some scenes just seemed to be there for the sake of it and the plot is considerably weaker than the original. But there are enough jokes and enough suspense to keep the film going so there's never a dull moment. Some might say that the story is a rehash of the original and that is partly true. That's the only real major flaw I find in Down Under.Benard and Bianca stay wonderfully in character and the new characters, such as Jake the Kangaroo Rat are very memorable too. Penny may have had Teddy for a friend but Cody has Marahute - a mighty Golden Eagle. Her movements are true to that of a real bird of prey, and yet she has a distinct humanoid quality. Whenever you look into her eyes, you know exactly what she's thinking. Jim Jordan (the voice of Orville) is sadly dead. (God rest his soul). But instead of replacing the voice actor, we have a new albatross - Orville's brother Wilbur. He is a worthy replacement. He provides plenty of comic relief, especially during his nightmarish time in hospital. Joanna the villain's sidekick is like Madame Medusa as a lizard. She looks like she came straight out of the original. McLeach, the evil poacher is a very intimidating villain. He's not as funny as Madame Medusa but he's not meant to be. He's not the sort of person you'd like to run into in the wilderness.If there's one aspect of this film that's superior to the first, it's the animation. The computer generated shots are spectacular. Sure, they might be dated today, but I think that the hand-drawn animation melds nicely with the CGI. Whilst the jungle in Tarzan looked like plastic, the rocks and cliffs in The Rescuers Down Under look realistic and full of texture. We have a lot of 'high-flying in the clouds' scenes which are a lot of fun and would be brilliant on the IMAX screen. Also, putting a tiny mouse against a vast landscape gives the movie an epic feel. Like the first Rescuers, the backgrounds are beautiful and pave the way for the beautiful scenery seen in The Lion King.However, Down Under does have its little flaws. One example is that Cody is Australian yet he speaks with an American accent. Also, how on earth did he climb up that huge cliff? There are other little inconsistencies too but they are easily overlooked.The sequel connects nicely with the original. A lot of the RAS mice from the original are seen again. Also, a lot of character designs are true to the first as well. Benard has hardly changed at all. Only Bianca looks somewhat different.In conclusion, The Rescuers Down Under is inferior to the original Rescuers, but it's still high-flying fun. This is definitely one of the better Disney sequels. So sit back and enjoy. Remember, you *could* be watching Pocahontas II."
3,The Rescuers Down Under,9,12 August 2003,Can this possibly be a cartoon?,"""The Rescuers Down Under"" is a wonderful tale, the rare film that surpasses its original in many, many ways. It has more flair, better animation and the characters are much more interesting. It is the sequel to ""The Rescuers,"" which was released 13 years earlier. They took their time making this sequel - and it paid off.  Cartoons can often be represented in a dull fashion, and others can take your breath away - this one takes your breath away.The intrepid mouse explorers Bernard and Bianca (voices of Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor) from the original film return in ""The Rescuers Down Under,"" when they hear word that a small boy in Australia has been kidnapped by a poacher named McLeach (voiced by the creepy George C. Scott). McLeach has also captured a large eagle, and the kidnapped boy, Cody, has a bond with the large beast.The Rescuers fly Down Under by hitching a ride on the hilarious, never over-the-top albatross Wilbur (voiced by John Candy). Once there, they pick up a local Aussie ""kangaroo mouse"" named Jake, who indeed resembles a miniature kangaroo. There are also some other delightful new characters, including Frank, a numbskull lizard, and Joanna the goanna lizard, the sidekick of McLeach. The key to this film is that they know how to make great characters - Joanna is just as fun to watch as Frank, and Jake is just as fun to watch as Bernard and Bianca. You never feel any hate towards any characters. My personal favorite was Wilbur, the albatross. He appears at various points in the film, caught in a mouse hospital, caught watching over eagle eggs, and caught hatching eagle eggs. He awaits the return of Bernard and Bianca, and he's too good-natured to just fly away and forget about them. And John Candy's voice talents are priceless.A lot of the amazing animation on this film takes place in the air, on the back of a soaring eagle. The animation in the original was raspy, dark and creepy. It wasn't nearly as breathtaking, or even enjoyable to watch. There also aren't any musical numbers in this film - at least not that I remember - and that also helps it out a bit. (I hated the original and its songs.) Maybe it's just me, but sometimes musical numbers don't fit into 'toons - and this is one of those.""The Rescuers Down Under"" is one of the best Disney films I have ever seen. The Disney animation of the 1970s, such as ""The Rescuers,"" was the low-point of Disney. The high-point was films like ""Pinnochio."" And in all honesty, this film is more interesting than both combined. It's got great animation, an intriguing and fun story, and excellent, well-developed characters. Only one thing entered my head when the credits started to roll: Can this possibly be a cartoon?4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer"
4,The Rescuers Down Under,8,21 July 2007,The good and the bad of 'The Rescuers Down Under',"The 29th animated Disney classic is, without a doubt, one of the only Disney sequels worth something. It is also one of the only sequels which belong to the canon list of Disney classics.This is a sequel to the classic 'The Rescuers' from 13 years before and it's quite different than what it was originally going to be. Instead of a sequel about Penny living happy with her adoptive parents, this is a brand new adventure.With the exception of Bernard, Miss Bianca and Mr. Chairman, the characters are all different. Almost the entire cast is different too, except Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor and Bernard Fox.To be fair, the original movie is far superior. That I definitely agree. However, some people consider this to be a disgrace and honestly it isn't that bad. Comparing to most Disney sequels, this is much better.Although this movie is brand new, it is naturally inspired by the original's idea. That's why it is so equal and so different at the same time.This time, instead of the Devil's Bayou, our mice heroes (Bernard and Bianca) go to Australia to save not a little girl, but a little boy named Cody who is in more danger than Penny was.Instead of Orville, this time who takes them to their destiny is his humorous brother Wilbur. There are no swamp animals this time and surprisingly no Evinrude. I'm surprised because Evinrude joins the RAS at the end of the original movie. Jake is their guide. Instead of Medusa, Snoops and Brutus & Nero, now the villain is an evil poacher named McLeach and his sidekick is a goanna named Joanna.Initially Orville was going to be in this movie, but after Jim Jordan's death in 1988 they created Wilbur with the voice of the comedian John Candy. That was a better and more clever solution than replacing the original voice. At least on this nobody can say they didn't do the right thing.The good of this movie: the sceneries are amazing, you can appreciate the natural beauty of Australia, that wonderful country nearly at the end of the world; Joanna is a comic relief, she's simply hilarious; there are some nice songs (such as the morbid ""Home on the Range"" by McLeach and the very lively ""Black Slacks"" by Joe Bennett and the Sparkletones); this movie is fun, has danger, action, adventure, darkness and classic humor; it has got one of the best Disney villains and one of my favorite Disney villains (McLeach); Wilbur is a very amusing character; Cody is a good boy; the glorious scenes with Cody and the magnificent & enormous golden eagle Marahute; it is one of the only good and watchable Disney sequels.The bad of this movie: mostly the disturbing moments with Wilbur suffering emotionally and physically at the hospital; the fact that the animals which are McLeach's prisoners are forgotten at the end, without knowing what happens to them; Wilbur is forgotten too and left all alone, but in a different way (still he is neglected); some characters aren't that appealing (such as Frank - although with his funny moments, he overacts and is so exaggerated that he quickly becomes tiring); the whole restaurant sequence, which is absolutely unnecessary and has no purpose for the rest of the film; it lacks character development (something which the first one does better); besides, this isn't as good as the first one, somehow lacking the charm of that one; unfortunately, it may also have been responsible for the mess of Disney sequels that would come in the following years.Despite its many faults, it is still a good movie. And, together with the original, it was an important part of my wonderful childhood. The intense nostalgia feeling it brings to those who grew up with it (like me) is more than enough to appreciate it better and excuse its faults. Besides, the fact that most Disney sequels pale next to this improves the impression on it. Nevertheless, this movie remains as one of the least appreciated Disney classics and quite underrated.The villain is a wanted local poacher. He drives a giant monstrous truck. He is pure evil, sadistic, greedy and even creepy at times (such as in one scene when his eyes glow red). He's got a morbid sense of humor, yet his patience is short and he's prone to major anger. So, McLeach is not the right guy to irritate. There's no denying that he is more dangerous, more cruel and more violent than Medusa. He's a killer. Joanna is used and abused by him (both physically and psychologically). Besides, he was gonna feed Cody to the crocodiles! But still he is a great villain.This should definitely be on Top 250."
5,The Rescuers Down Under,10,18 January 2006,Pure Disney entertainment,"THE RESCUERS, in my opinion, is pure Disney entertainment. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Bernard (voice of Bob Newhart) and Bianca (voice of Eva Gabor) set out on their mission to rescue Cody (voice of Adam Ryen) and the rare golden eagle. If you ask me, McLeach (voice of George C. Scott) was absolutely nefarious. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. Also, after having seen this movie, I would love to go to Australia one day. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney blockbuster to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it."
6,The Rescuers Down Under,9,27 August 2011,Most underrated Disney movie ever!,"This has been a family favorite ever since it came out and it's sad that not many people appreciate it for what it is.This is less of a sequel and more of a separate story with only three characters (the chubby mouse in charge of the Rescue Aid Society, Wilbur, and Miss Bianca) returning, this time to rescue Cody, a young boy who is attempting to rescue animals from poachers and is kidnapped in the process. His most recent animal rescue is Marahute, the golden eagle.While disjointed in places, this film proves to be a fun little thrill ride. The main characters are fairly well-developed though typically one-dimensional. The only one who shows a character arc is Bernard, who finally has a chance to move past his superstitious, worrisome nature and find some courage.MacLeech, the poacher villain, is sufficiently creepy and his huge lizard sidekick Joanna is awesomely funny. Our family has even developed the habit for calling 'Joannaaaaaa!' whenever we see a really big lizard, so enthralled we are with the reptile. Another funny character is Frank the frilled lizard, who never fails to bring giggles.The good parts about this film are the typically wonderful animation (first animated Disney movie with computer animation!) and the AWESOME music. It's wonderful! No song-and-dance numbers and a sweeping score, composed by Bruce Broughton (Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey). The liberal use of woodwinds serves the story well, able to bring sadness in certain areas and playfulness in others.The best part in the movie is easily the flying sequence, which never fails to bring goosebumps. I would go so far as to say the third shot from the last (where Cody is pushed off the edge of the waterfall) is the best shot in Disney animation history.Overall, a fun romp that doesn't have enough appreciation."
7,The Rescuers Down Under,10,8 July 2008,Great Story towards Animals,I have been watching this movie since I was a kid. Its a great movie. It shows a good background towards how to treat animals and how its not right to poach them like McCleach did and how you should always help them if there in terrible trouble. I cry a lot when I see this movie. I especially cry at the scene where McCleach captures the eagle. The ending I like because its real happy. The music goes real good with this movie. If anyone is looking for a movie thats good with comedy and with animal protection. Its this one definitely. Its says at the end Special Thanks to San Diego Wild Animal Park. Those of you that haven't watched this movie please watch it you will cry your eyes out.
8,The Rescuers Down Under,9,28 July 2007,Fab,"I love this movie. I saw the original on the cinema when it was re-released and then of course saw this. It is in my opinion the only decent sequel Disney has ever made.(2D animation anyway, Toy Story 2 is superb) All the others have been straight-to-video and terrible. (Lady and the Tramp 2/Pocahontas 2 etc) The animation in Down Under is superb, the voice talent outstanding, and the villain in the shape of John McCleach very very funny. There are no songs, and actually, you don't notice the lack of them. I think it works better. The best line in the film has to be McCleachs' boast: ""I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing!"""
9,The Rescuers Down Under,9,30 March 2006,A Perfect Example of A Perfect Sequel,"The first one was overall a cute film, definitely a classic, but nothing to scream about, you know what I mean? Anyways, as a kid I would always take characters who would look cool in some big action powered flick with high drama and adventure. Having a real evil villain that threatens death, and kick the pace up a notch from the original movie.My wish came true, The Rescuers Down Under was a high powered animated action flick with intense drama and heart-pounding emotion. Severely different from the original, which was about two little mice sent out on a mission to save a little girl held captive by a vile woman in search for a priceless diamond. This time, a young boy named Cody was kidnapped by a poacher named McLeach, who desperately wants to enormous eagle that was just saved from captivity. Despite the dangers, these two little mice named Bernard and Miss Bianca head out on probably the most daring rescue ever assigned to the R.A.S. (Rescue Aid Society). Without a moment to lose, they hop aboard the big bird named Wilbur to a nonstop flight to Australia. From then on its just keeps getting better, and the filmmakers weren't afraid how far they strayed from the kinder hearted tone of the original. That's a good thing.This was easily put in my top animated films, behind Beauty and the Beast and the Prince of Egypt of course. It was a little shorter than I would have liked, which doesn't make this brilliant film absolutely spotless. None the less I recommend this to anyone looking for menacing fun. Trust me, this is a brilliant film that may be a little too intense for the younglings, but still a family film which I think will be loved by adults and kids alike.****/**** starsThe Rescuers Down Under (1990): Rated PG for intense moments"
10,The Rescuers Down Under,10,10 February 2004,"Epic, one of Disney's underrated gems","When it comes to Disney sequels, most are usually OK or just plain bad, The Rescuers Down Under is not only the first Disney sequel but the best Disney sequel to this day. It surpassed the first film by far and I have loved it since I was a little girl. When I bought it on DVD as a grown up, I was thinking that I wouldn't have the same feelings since you're a kid, everything seems amazing. But still rewatching it, this is an incredible movie. The first Rescuers is such a sappy movie, it's a good one, but it's just a tear jerker from beginning to end. This film was epic, the animation is beyond incredible and the story was way too excellent.In the Australian Outback, a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends a rare golden eagle called Marahute, who shows him her nest and eggs. Later, the boy is captured in an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local wanted poacher. When McLeach finds one of the eagle's feathers in the boy's backpack he is instantly overcome with excitement, he knew that capturing the bird would make him rich. McLeach kidnaps the boy and attempts to force out of him the whereabouts of the rare eagle, even going as far as offering to split the profit with him. But the Rescuers hear of Cody's troubles from a mouse had saved earlier in the film and they go to save him and the magnificent eagle.I don't even know where to begin on the excellence of this film. First off the animation, there's this shot of the outback that just ranges to what seems like forever and the music that plays during that scene makes you feel like you're really there. The scenes where Cody is flying with the bird is just epic and beautiful. The characters are wonderful, you could feel the power of the bird and you just want nothing but evil karma to come down upon the villain for trying to capture something so majestic and incredible. Cody is a very likable hero who has respect for all living creatures. And of course our famous rescuers are back and they are better than ever in helping Cody save the eagle. If you're ever going to see a Disney sequel, I would always recommend The Rescuers Down Under. It's a great movie in general, I would say it stands well on it's own. It's a terrific underrated gem that needs more recognition.10/10"
11,The Rescuers Down Under,10,16 June 2009,My Favorite Disney Animated Film.,"Often times in a series of films, the sequel is far inferior to the original film. However in the case of The Rescuers Down Under, the sequel is a million times better than the original and also my favorite Disney Animated Film.A young boy named Cody lives in Australia and goes around befriending many different species of animals. This includes the great giant golden eagle named Marahute. However Cody is soon captured by an evil poacher named Mcleach, who is after the golden eagle. It is up to Bernard and Bianca to rescue Cody and the golden eagle.First off I must say that the animation in this film may be the best that I have ever seen in any animated film. ALl of the scenery is amazing and the wildlife in this film all look real. This is one major reason why this film is far better than the first Rescuers film. Here is an example. In The Rescuers, there are two alligators in the film that look quite ridiculous and add comic relief I feel. However in The Rescuers Down Under, the crocodiles in the film look and act how crocodiles act in real life leading this film to be more realistic. I love how the crocodiles look and act in this film because crocodiles are my favorite animal.The fact that this film is set in Australia is awesome because that truly is the most interesting continent out there. All of the animals in this film are around in real life and you get to see a lot of species of different animals. This includes kangaroos, koalas, frilled lizards, goana, crocodiles, and many others. As far as accurate depictions of real areas and the animals that live there, this film is just as good as The Lion King in that regard.The main villain, Mcleach, is an outstanding one. He is an evil poacher who works well mainly because the threat that he possesses seems like it could really happen. Also he has a sense of humor. For the most part a great villain because it is one that could easily really exist and makes Mcleach work all the better.This film does not have any songs in it. I think that helps to make the film more realistic and give it a more serious tone. It may be the only animated Disney film, not including pixar films, that has no songs in it.Bianca and Bernard are both back. However it is all of the other characters that seem to make the film better and not them. As far as leading characters go I guess they are OK, but The Rescuers is considered a disappointment and the fact that this film is so good not because of them shows that they really are not that exciting.I think this film is incredibly under rated. That may be because I am sure that many people associate this film with The Rescuers. However this film stands by itself in my opinion. The Rescuers Down Under is a great Disney FIlm that I highly recommend."
12,The Rescuers Down Under,8,7 September 2005,A rare example of a sequel that is an improvement over the original.,"After nearly two decades of disappointing animated movies, the Disney folks got back to winning ways in 1989 with The Little Mermaid. That marked the start of a succession of five Disney cartoons in a row that were all of a really high quality, the five being The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. The second film on this list - The Rescuers Down Under - is a rip-roaring adventure movie which is a sequel to an earlier Disney movie made in 1977. In fact, the original The Rescuers was a pretty forgettable film and it seems extremely strange that the Disney people had that particular film in mind when they decided to make a sequel. This second instalment is thankfully much more memorable, well-animated ad exciting. It's not often that it can be said, but this is a case of a sequel which is superior to the original.In the Australian Outback, a young boy named Cody (voice of Adam Reyen) rescues and befriends a rare golden eagle. Later, the boy is captured in a trap by wanted local poacher McLeach (voice of George C. Scott). When McLeach finds one of the eagle's feathers in the boy's backpack he is instantly overcome with excitement, for he knows that to capture such a grandiose bird would make him filthy rich! McLeach kidnaps the boy and attempts to force out of him the whereabouts of the rare eagle. Meanwhile, a message is sent to New York, home of the Rescue Aid Society.... a bunch of dare-devil mice who specialise in saving the lives of endangered children. Once again, mice agents Bernard (voice of Bob Newhart) and Bianca (voice of Eva Gabor) find themselves up to their neck in adventure as they try to rescue young Cody from his abductor's lair.The animation in this 1990 release is absolutely excellent and seems to mark a significant step forward in terms of the technology available to animators. The story is exciting and fast-paced, with just a sprinkling of humour to offer a little relief from the action from time to time. On the whole, the voice acting is very good, most notably Newhart and Gabor as the heroes, with solid support from John Candy's comical albatross and Scott's seriously unpleasant villain. Purists might be surprised and disappointed by the lack of the usual catchy Disney songs (there are none in this one, not even a theme song over the credits), but in most departments this is a first-rate animated movie that should enthral kids and adults alike."
13,The Rescuers Down Under,9,3 October 2012,An under-appreciated sequel and one of the better ones at that!,"Having been a fan of the Rescuers which was a compelling and underrated film in my opinion, I heard that Disney made a sequel to this 13 years later. I was like, ""Dang. That's a pretty long time to fully develop a sequel. Sure, Return to Oz, the sequel to The Wizard of Oz, was released 46 years later, but it's a little bit difficult to compare the two even though The Wizard of Oz wasn't made by Disney to begin with. With that said, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" fully captivated me when I first saw it and given it's number #11 spot at top 11 underrated nostalgic classics made by Nostalgia Critic himself, I personally agree that like The Rescuers, this is one of the most under-appreciated films and a better one at that (along with Aladdin and the King of Thieves, The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, and Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time) The storyline, like the original, is very good and much more engaging with lots of great suspense throughout the film along with some great flying moments with Marahute, which really wowed me the first time I saw her. The characters are as likable as they were in the first film especially Bernard and Biana. The new characters including the rousing Australian mouse named Jake and the hilarious seagull Wilbur along with the other animals attempting to guide Cody were enjoyable to see and Cody, despite his unnatural dialog due to his accent that several users commented on, is at least likable. The main villain Percival M. Mcleach, although not on par with some of my favorite Disney villains, is a great menacing bad-guy with an excellent voice-work from George C. Scott. In fact, the voice acting was pretty good especially John Candy's. The music from Bruce Broughton is excellent and fitted really well for the action moments in the movie and even the pacing is very brisk.Overall, The Rescuers Down Under may not be one of Disney's greatest films ever made, but much like The Rescuers, this is a greatly underrated sequel that deserves much more recognition. Besides, it's a shame that a Rescuers 3 hasn't been made."
14,The Rescuers Down Under,9,23 March 2006,Did we all see the same movie?,"I am surprised by the comments here. It is as if people were seeing two different movies -- one that was really bad and one that was really good. There doesn't seem to be any in between.Weird.I for one thought this was an outstanding film. And would agree with the reviewer who placed it up there with the other four Disney triumphs of the early 1990's, although I would have added Pocahontas to that -- not for the story but the animation (e.g. Colors of the Wind) was spectacular.One superb aspect of TRDU was the score by Bruce Broughton. WOW! A wonderful mix of Strauss, Sibelius and Aboriginal sounds. And yes..NO SONGS! Thank GOD! The main theme was swashbuckling and heartwarming all at the same time. Very Cool!My 4 year old wants to be Cody. That's my barometer of a great Disney movie."
15,The Rescuers Down Under,9,17 March 2005,A truly underrated Disney gem,"By all accounts, the lion's share of Disney sequels sorely lack any semblance of the pure Disney magic that we all could come to expect from the films that preceded them. And it's easy to disseminate the root causes. They are not well storyboarded from the get-go, are completed outside of Disney Feature Animation's walls, and not surprisingly, are micromanaged into a cookie-cutter recipe from above by less-than-talented management.And this has to do with ""Rescuers Down Under""...how? It doesn't, and I love it. Disney's first attempt at an animated sequel was a magical brew of the same ingredients that made ""Rescuers"" endeared by so many, young and old. And what's more, the differences between the two have made ""Down Under"" down right better. This was Disney's first foray into the world of 3d animation, and the beauty of its use in the film is that it's utilized fairly sparingly, and I'm convinced that they knew the technology wasn't yet powerful enough to warrant use all on its own. The color schemes give me a sense of warmth, like I assume the land down under is nearly year-round. It's not nearly as dark and drab as its predecessor, so the sense of innocence so lost is felt on a deeper level than with Penny of the original.""Down Under""'s opening 20 minute salvo could be categorized as its weaker point because of its lack of the main story's progression, but I beg to differ. Disney's cornerstone formula of a magical movie-going experience has always been storytelling, and it's most apparent in the first 20 minutes. This is when we truly know how deep the bonds run through the boy and the massive golden eagle not just because he initially rescues her from a poacher's trap, but when she rescues him from a perilous fall down a cliff she bumped him off from and flies him back to her nest, we know the connection is quite mutual. Now we know the depths that one is willing to go through to rescue the other.The voice acting cannot go unnoticed, either. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor return, respectively, as Bernard and Miss Bianca and prove that thirteen years between the two Rescuers movies didn't diminish their abilities at all. Wilbur's performance by the late great John Candy make this it as memorable as any one of his live action movies. McLeach, the evil poacher, is given new depths of eeee-vilness by George C. Scott, who had definitely made his niche in the characterization in movies past. The glaring lack of an Australian accent aside, Adam Ryen's performance as Cody is right on par and was crucial to the ability to connect with the character.Neither can the powerful performance by Glen Keane, animator extraordinaire of Marahute the golden eagle, go overlooked. From the first frame, it is very obvious that he is intimately familiar with the body of an eagle and all its workings, and on through to the last frame, I know that he had all the time and resources he needed to complete such an awesome effort.But honestly, what kind of 8-year-old could have visualized the movie on this kind of level when it had barely come out fifteen years ago? Really, the only thing that mattered to me was that I felt a bond with the boy, a deep-down conviction that the trials he endures are happening to me in a different plane of being. And when the final credits have rolled, that is ultimately what makes or breaks such a movie, which definitely made it great.""Rescuers Down Under"" gets 9 of 10 stars"
16,The Rescuers Down Under,10,17 November 2009,On the best underrated Disney films,"How is did it flop? Because, people cant get past that dumb old unoriginal happy-singy crap fest you get with most animated movie. Because this movie was nothing like that. No songs, darker themes, amazing animation and action that leaves you wanting more. Possibly the fourth best Disney movie of the Renaissance of the late 80s-90s. (The other three would be, 3rd Aladdin, 2nd Beauty and the Beast, 1st Lion King) And personally one of my favorite movies. Its an original story that takes place in a peculiar and rarely used place, Australia. With peril and and danger around every corner, its an action flick about a young boy who was kidnapped by a mad hunter and is rescued by three little mice who work for a secret society of child-saving mice. Like, honestly anyone who finds this movie ""dumb!"" ""Stoopid"" ""Crappy kids carTOOn movie"" needs to watch it again and really analyze how great it is."
17,The Rescuers Down Under,,6 March 2002,"Good kid flick, but not a complete ending","There is a lot to look at during the movie, but most kids don't watch animated films for the scenery. Characters are well developed at the expense of a satisfactory ending. Wilbur, voiced by John Candy & Frank, voice by Wayne Robson are great additions to the rescuers' cast. My beef with the film is at the end when Gordy says let's go home, there are the loose ends of the poor animals still in cages that we don't see freed and we never get to see joy on Gordy's Mother's face on his return from the dead. I guess they just ran out of ink."
18,The Rescuers Down Under,10,8 October 2013,"Outshining even some of Walt's projects (I know, blasphemy)","Disney has had a history of taking touching, beautiful movies that were entertaining and high quality and using them as a crutch for really poor sequels, prequels and ""midquels"" that have no effort put into them and are just made to make a quick profit. Seriously, Disney executives, have you no knowledge of what Walt was all about when it came to movies? Down Under is the exact opposite. It takes a boring if not slightly humorous movie from 20 years prior and makes a dark, emotionally touching thrill ride of a sequel on armored vehicles and giant eagles. It takes McLeach, no more than a humble poacher trying to make a dishonest buck, and turns him into a cut-throat knife-wielding killer who may very well be one of the smartest villains Disney ever produced. Hell, it makes AN ALBATROSS (voiced by John Candy) GETTING MEDICAL TREATMENT into an exciting subplot. Only in this movie, people, only in THIS movie.The visuals and CGI are spectacular, the shots of the golden eagle being some of the best. The heroes, the villains, and the support cast are all fun to watch; even McLeach's pet lizard-komoto-dragon-salamander-thingy is worth a few laughs. There are no musical numbers, forced or otherwise, to interfere with this movie's grand performance. Without a doubt, one of the most underrated unacknowledged MOVIES, Disney's or anyone else's, of all time. Why this didn't explode into a franchise is anyone's guess.Unless you're a Disney executive."
19,The Rescuers Down Under,8,15 August 2008,The lost 29th,"In most books about Disney, when you come across the late 80's-90's you see only the Musicals like Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, and Lion king. When i read the back of My 1998 little mermaid VHS, i saw that it was the 28th. I remembered that Beauty and the beast was the 30th. What about the 29th? What was it? I went to my library and borrowed a copy of The Rescuers Down under and was completely blown away. The story of a boy and a magnificent eagle, who need the help of 2 little mice to save them from a villainous poacher and once again save the day. this film has to be my favorite sequel of a Disney film along with Lion king 2 and Aladdin 3."
20,The Rescuers Down Under,10,3 July 2004,I say that Marahute stole the show and I have ideas if they showed more,"I found out that her wingspan is 40 feet and she is 10 feet tall. Cody only got a spinal feather from the bird. He could have got a 8 foot long wing feather from her. Wilbur would realize these are eaglets that just hatched. He'd immediately think these are from an eagle that's the size of a pterodactyl. Then perhaps after Cody goes back to his home, tells his mother everything that happened, Marahute would go back to her nest and see that an albatross decided to babysit. Wilbur would introduce himself to that giant among birds. Then years pass and the eaglets are mature and reproduce. This could result in this eagle being numerous. First to Australia, then to the world. People would ride on some of them. It would be a marvelous and joyous addition to make this movie the real top of the line. Think of having such a creature as a pet. The only flyng creatures that exceeded that size are pterodactyls. I think that's all I should say."
21,The Rescuers Down Under,8,29 June 2013,Every bit as good as the original but with more thrills,"This is one film I may have seen as a child but I didn't see it in full until a few months ago on my flight home from Dubai. I watched this immediately after the original to see if it was any better or worse. In fact, it's one of those sequels that's just as good as the original (Likewise with the first two 'Home Alone' films being as funny and entertaining as each other). I will also give this film some credit for technically being the first Disney sequel ever but unlike the 'Cinderella' and 'Aladdin' sequels, this one was theatrically released and is actually part of the Disney animated Classics canon. There are certain aspects of this film that surpassed the original such as its animation being fluid and rich in cel-shading and the majority of backgrounds being more colourful than those in the first film, despite the backgrounds from that film being very artistic. What also pleased me was that Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprised their roles as Bernard and Bianca, which is very rare when it comes to animated sequels. Cody was a decent and fun character, although I would have liked him better if he had an Australian accent (only about four characters in this film have this accent). McLeach was a terrifying villain who was just as menacing as Madame Medusa in the original and Wilbur was a funny addition to the cast of characters, especially when he danced to an upbeat song before Bernard and Bianca asked him to fly them to Australia and several mice tried to operate on him. Joanna was a comical sidekick of McLeach's and her character trait was reminiscent of that of Brutus and Nero. Other redeeming qualities of this film were some breathtaking animation sequences (such as the eagle flight scenes) and the brief running gag of Bernard trying to propose to Bianca but getting interrupted. If I had any other gripes of this film, Cody's mother was hardly ever seen and the ending was surprising and confusing because as the film progressed, I thought the ending would show Cody reuniting with his mother when, in fact, the eagle just flew him home and this was followed by Wilbur being stranded in the cliff, calling out for Bernard and Bianca and hatching the eggs. When I first saw this film in its entirety, I thought it was McLeach that was calling out to the heroic mice but after close inspection, he had actually fallen to his death down a waterfall, which took Disney villain deaths to a new level.Overall, this was a thrilling film that was every bit as entertaining as the original, despite its unexpected flaws. 8/10."
22,The Rescuers Down Under,8,27 November 2006,"A good Disney movie, definitely worth watching","The Rescuers Down Under is an excellent Disney movie. Unlike its more recent dismal flops, this movie is very well done and is beautifully animated. The plot is fine and the movie is watchable by adults as well as children, though it is targeted for the latter.The Rescuers Down Under is probably visually the best animated movie ever produced. The animation is gorgeous, and Marahute, the Outback, McLeach's base and animals, and the main characters are all beautiful. The backgrounds are excellent, and as a pure work of art this is the best of the Disney movies.Plot-wise, though, it is fairly simplistic. It does have a subplot (Bernard trying to work up the guts to propose to Bianca), but the main plot of the movie is pretty rote: someone has been kidnapped, and its up to the main characters to save them. It is fairly similar to The Rescuers, though The Rescuers Down Under executes the plot better and is far more gripping, as the boy and Marahute are far more empathetic characters than Penny. The villain McLeach is quite possibly the most menacing of all Disney villains; he's an incredibly dark character who seems to have no compunctions about killing, and is very amoral.This movie is one of the few Disney films which isn't a musical, which may throw some people off, but it makes the movie far more compelling; there aren't pointless breaks in the plot, and it makes it a lot easier to watch as an adult.Overall, this is the only worthwhile Disney sequel. It is superior to its predecessor, The Rescuers, and is a well-executed movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Disney movies or who has children."
23,The Rescuers Down Under,6,2 October 2009,"A spectacle of a movie, though nowhere near as good as the first one","The biggest disappointment I have when hearing about The Rescuers Down Under is just how much of an improvement it supposedly is to the first movie, The Rescuers from 1977. I just cannot comprehend this idea. The Rescuers was an exceptionally well-made movie, with a strong plot and an unforgettable visual style. Out of the Disney movies that aren't heavyweight classics, it's one of the studio's very best. The Rescuers Down Under is often gorgeous to look at. But it's not by any means half the movie the original was.The good stuff in Down Under is obvious. The three dimensional landscapes, the effect shots, the good voice cast and the wonderful music all create a movie that LOOKS and SOUNDS just absolutely great. It's a spectacle to watch the many sequences taking place in the air, the eagle flight in the opening and that mindblowing descent into a blizzardy New York City from the albatross. It takes your breath away every time. It is the very anti-thesis to the first movie, which was mellow and low-key, which used an almost eerie silence during a lot of dramatic events and had very few action scenes at all. As an adventure movie, Down Under is often a treat.But there are many things with the movie that bothers me a lot. The first film was dark and atmospheric, even poetic at times. I know it's going to sound strange but I find the movie is too ""kid friendly"". It's not that a Disney movie shouldn't welcome it's target audience, it's just that I get the feeling the movie is really taking the kids for granted, rather than working in their service. There is something so redundant and automatic with the plot of this movie. A generic boy with no greater character traits (other than being a morally correct role model) is captured by a big evil poacher McLeach, wonderfully voiced by George C. Scott, driving around in an elaborately huge war-machine and living in a big, evil looking, home-made hunting lair (we learn he is wanted.... you'd think he'd be more discreet!). To the rescue are Bernard and Bianca, who are introduced with a slapstick scene where Bernard tries to get back the wedding ring he tries to present to Bianca. The thing about The international Rescue Aid Society, which served as a big and great introduction scene in the first movie, is over within less than a minute. In a movie 74 minutes long, couldn't we at least get that catchy rescue song? But were not wasting time in the 90's, we hurry off to Australia where we get a great character in Jake, the Australian kangaroo, but he gets almost nothing to do in the movie (though he surely serves as a good toy for McDonald's). Meanwhile, the kid in McLeach's lair also meet some new characters as it turns out that McLeach holds several animals captive in his basement. We get a few lines from a grumpy koala, and a few from a very well mannered kangaroo, but most of the attention goes to an obnoxious lizard that I don't recall at all from my childhood. It's one of those obligatory comic relief characters that they think will amuse the kids, and I don't know, maybe they do. But I still think it's annoying to give so much screen time to a stupid and annoying lizard when they could have made something memorable, with proper character. The swamp folks in the original Rescuers were more like adults (albeit drinking rednecks, but who's perfect right?) and if memorable comic reliefs is your bag, the silent firefly Evinrude was unforgettable. The most memorable sidekick in this movie is Joanna, the dumb iguana of McLeach's. She is most fittingly a follower to the eels in The Little Mermaid and a precursor to the hyenas in The Lion King and she is both funny, well drawn and have a strong character (unlike many of the other characters in this movie). McLeach is also a good, if a little standard, villain.The movie wraps itself up pretty quickly and the plot is lazy, automatic and doesn't even believe in itself - we MUST have, I suppose, a comic relief sidestory involving John Candy's albatross. It does not serve the story of the movie at all, but I suspect the film makers didn't have any ideas, so they just threw in these hysterical scenes to make a couple of minutes pass. What made the first movie so good, besides that it too was gorgeous to watch, was that it had a plot that held up. One girl trapped in a scary swamp. Two detective mice getting closer to actually finding her within an actual investigation (in Down Under that's not even a problem, as said they don't waste time). One flight to Devil's Bay, one team-up with the girl, one scheme, one evil lady and two crocodiles, some swamp people, scary pivotal scene in a cave, finale with fireworks, all ends well. It's a great movie! In Down Under the mice act just so that the movie can continue until it ends, meanwhile giving us great stuff to look at, some comic relief and some tension that is generic and un-original. Get this: The movie doesn't even have the interest to show a reunion between the boy and his mother! This despite the fact that we learn his dad has died and that the police take the boy for dead too. Down Under tells its story sloppy and automatic.Even so, it's an entertaining film, mostly due to it's great looks. But it does feel calculated and soulless in comparison to The Rescuers, which was a genuine, original and actually pretty bold animated movie that didn't take kids for granted and made a movie that anyone can enjoy to fullest degree. I don't think Down Under has that power, and I don't think it is half the movie the original was."
24,The Rescuers Down Under,8,30 July 2007,Sequels!,"Good, but for some reason, it just does not hit it off with me as well as the original did. It does have a sense of wonder, amazement, and excitement, but its own kind, not the same kind as the original did, has, and always will with me. The animation, however, is better than the dark, creepy, and to little kids, perhaps scary animation that was in most of the original. The only parts in the original that did not have that kind of animation were, basically, whenever they were inside. But why does Cody's mother show no emotion when they bring the backpack, except holding it close? Also, why don't our heroes go back for the other animals in McLeach's prison? After all, our heroes were headed home, but maybe they were going to McLeach's prison on the way. I do like how the story did not tell what happened to McLeach, but on the other hand, maybe he got to the bottom unharmed,waded out of the water, collapsed, soaking wet, on the bank, and looked up and seen the rangers, ready and waiting for him. Or maybe he could have hit his head on the sharp rocks at the bottom (we know there have to be sharp rocks at the bottom, I mean, we HAVE all seen ""The Emperor's New Groove"", right?) and found his way to the nearest sanitarium, crazy, demented, and insane, and spent the rest of his life, bedridden, yelling and screaming about who knows what. For anybody who LIKES?!? McLeach, you are probably hoping that he got the first one, but for all of us who DISLIKE McLeach, we are hoping that he got the second one. Finally, what ever happened to Wilbur and the little baby birds? Maybe our heroes dropped by and ""rescued"" them, too. I did'nt make it all the way through third grade for nothing!"
25,The Rescuers Down Under,,21 October 2003,One of the over-looked greats from Disney,"Along with The Great Mouse Detective, The Rescuers Down Under is a wonderful adventure with some early experimentation with computer animation. A compelling story with plot complications mature enough to engage adults, the visuals are matched by the strong voice cast including Geroge C. Scott as a suitably nasty villian. As is often Disney custom, the villian is matched with a comic relief side kick (in this case a mute lizard henchman). One of the best examples of cinematic comic timing involves the two characters counting eggs. I highly recommend this movie for Disney animation fans who may have over-looked this gem."
26,The Rescuers Down Under,,31 January 1999,This Was Half Decent,"I had the Flu and I woke up to find my 15 year-old sister was watching this film and I was thinking, my God! I sat through it, though, and It turned out to be pretty good.I Liked the original Rescuers a lot. There's just something about Disney you can't resist. ( ADVICE TO ALL PROFESSIONAL ACTORS : If you're career is in trouble go for a Disney film---you can't go wrong! )Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart were great as Miss Bianca and Bernard, they made the movie ( hullo, they're only the lead characters ) Jake got on my nerves. I don't know why but her did. I didn't like how he interfered with Miss B and Bernard, and he was written poorly for a hero. It's usually the villains who have the cheap lines.Red was hilarious. I thought he was one of the best Disney villains in years. Joanna was just great. She was my favorite character in the entire movie. She made me laugh whenever she came on screen and the name really fit the character ( it's an inside joke ). All in all this film's a keeper.8.5/10"
27,The Rescuers Down Under,7,4 February 2007,"Not a Disney ""classic"" but enjoyable, nonetheless!","Released after the triumph that was ""The Little Mermaid"" and before the glories of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King,"" ""The Rescuers Down Under"" was a film that, though moderately successful, doesn't classify as one of the studio's best. However, the film does have its highlights, from the casting to wondrous animated sequences.Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprise their roles from the original (""The Rescuers"") as rodents that respond to a distress call from The Australian Outback. Aided by a daffy albatross, well-played by John Candy, the pair make their way ""down under"" and come upon a sinister poacher (George C. Scott). The poacher is aided by a not-too-bright salamander named Joanna (Frank Welker). The exchanges between the poacher and his aide are hilarious, making the lizard one of the film's strong points.Other pluses is the eagle family, spectacularly animated as it soars in the sky. The film's opening sequence is a genuine masterpiece, standing as one of the best ever for an animated film.Bruce Broughton's score is particularly exciting, befitting the setting and the storyline."
28,The Rescuers Down Under,8,3 September 2010,I personally think this is better than the original. MUCH better!,"I finally saw the 1977 animated Disney film, ""The Rescuers"", for the first time late last month, and even after two viewings, I could only give it a 6/10 (it only improved slightly the second time). I don't think I ever saw that film as a kid, but did see this 1990 sequel, ""The Rescuers Down Under"". I remember seeing it on video within the next several years after its release more than once, and am not sure whether I ever saw the whole thing or not, but if not, I still saw a lot of it, even though I couldn't remember the title. Even if I didn't really like the original that much, I was still bound to watch this sequel afterwards, since I had some memory of it from my childhood, and I have no regrets about that, since it is two stars higher than the original in my book! Cody is a young boy who lives in the Australian Outback. When he is informed by his kangaroo friend, Faloo that a golden eagle named Marahute has been trapped, the boy goes and successfully frees the bird, even befriending her. However, soon after leaving Marahute's nest, Cody meets an evil poacher named Percival McLeach, who wants to capture the golden eagle, knowing he could get rich by doing so, since this bird is so rare! He abducts Cody and intends to somehow get the boy to tell him where this eagle is! When the news of this abduction reaches the Rescue Aid Society, another meeting in New York is called to order, this time on a stormy winter night. Miss Bianca and Bernard are chosen for the mission to go to Australia and save Cody, so the brave mice ride an albatross named Wilbur out of the snowstorm and into the much warmer weather of the Outback, where more danger awaits them.I think this sequel is better than the original for a number of reasons. I was not impressed with the songs sung by Shelby Flint in the first film, but in ""Down Under"", there are no songs (though that could be a problem for some viewers). This movie also has a more entertaining main villain than its predecessor does, and the villain here is Percival McLeach, voiced very nicely by George C. Scott. There are some comical moments involving him and his goanna, Joanna, such as the egg stealing one, featuring a line I used to like to quote for a while as a kid, which was, ""Did you take one of my eggs?"" This brings me to another thing I like better about this sequel. It has more laughs than the original, not only with the villains, but also in scenes such as Miss Bianca talking about the mission while Bernard thinks she's talking about their wedding, and many scenes involving the antics of Wilbur. It helps that the voice of this albatross character is provided by John Candy. More still, the characters here are generally more entertaining than the ones in the 1977 film, I think I found more excitement in this 1990 sequel, and there are some great backgrounds here, including the ones for the Outback, where most of the film takes place. This scenery makes for a nice atmosphere.This 1990 family adventure was the first ever sequel to an animated Disney movie. Since then, many more have been made, but most of them have gone straight to video, unlike ""The Rescuers Down Under"", which was played in theatres. This film is probably better than any of Disney's direct-to-video sequels that I've seen, most of which aren't very good. Watching this particular Disney flick was also one of those rare cases where I found the sequel to be better than the original, and it's amazing how many ways it's better than 1977's ""The Rescuers""! I didn't like everything about this film, as there were times when it did seem somewhat bland around the beginning, and maybe sometimes a bit kiddish. Still, while this film might have a little more for kids than it does for adults, I still found it entertaining enough to recommend for Disney fans of all ages. It apparently didn't do well at the box office, but it is good family fare nonetheless."
29,The Rescuers Down Under,8,8 August 1999,Some of the best of Walt Disney before commercial success,"Ok, the setting. Walt Disney movies hadn't been the same since Walt's death. Box office success seems to elude the company and ambitious projects like The Black Hole don't deliver. What's worse, Bluth's new company puts successful family animated entertainment back on the charts with The Secret of NIMH. A big embarrassment to Disney and perhaps a wake-up call to get back on the animated ball. So the folks at Disney came up with a sequel to their semi-successful Rescuers movie. I think this sequel was much better than the first. Excellent story coupled with good animation and an politically correct eco-care theme to boot. This movie really did deserve the success and attention it brought back to the company. I would be willing to bet that this movie's success proved Disney still had the stuff and probably provided the impetus to invest in their next movie, ""The Little Mermaid"" ... and the rest is history. Of course, with the success of Mermaid, Disney has stuck with the formula of working off of established folk-tales for their animated fare, unfortunately neglecting modern themes seen in ""The Secret of NIMH and this movie. So check this movie out to see Disney at some of its best, and before they delved back into less risky, safe, folksy storylines responsible for their commercial success over the past 10 years."
30,The Rescuers Down Under,9,1 September 2012,One of the Few Sequels that's Superior to the Original!!!,"The Rescuers Down Under is Disney's 29th full-length animated motion picture released in 1990, 13 years after the original ""Rescuers"" was released and was the first sequel to a Disney animated movie. Instead of the continuation of Penny's story, Disney's smallest (and unlikeliest of heroes), Bernard and Bianca (voiced by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor respectively), after receiving an urgent distress signal, are sent by the Rescue Aid Society to the ""land down under"" of Australlia to rescue a young boy named Cody and his magnificent eagle Marahute who've been kidnapped by the dangerous, wanted local poacher McCleach (voiced by George C. Scott) and his sidekick Joanna, who are after the eagles eggs. Together with their new friends Wilbur, the maniacal pilot (voiced by John Candy, who replaces his brother Orville) and the small-rough-and-tough Aussie Jake (voiced by Tristan Rogers), they'll overcome some of the most dangerous and insurmountable odds to rescue the boy from McCleach's evil clutches. Here are the following reasons why I think this movie is superior to the original: The animation was brighter, bolder, and more detailed than the sketchy-style of the original ""Rescuers"" as this was the first movie to experiment with Disney's new form of animation, CAPS (which was fully used in ""Beauty and the Beast""); The setting and plot was better developed; the Devil's bayou in the original has nothing on the wonder and majesty of the Australlian Outback which created real danger and some tense situations (the opening sequence where Cody flies with Marahute over Australlia is absolutely amazing and pure Disney magic!!!), and the villain is much better in this one. Medusa was pretty nasty, but McCleach is ten times more dangerous, evil, violent, and nasty than Medusa as he threatened to kill Cody with his gun, threatened him with his knife and even threatened to feed him to the crocodiles!!! He is not the right guy to mess with and to me, he's one of the greatest Disney villains ever (definitely in my top 10!!!). This is one of Disney's most underrated films of all-time! When people discuss the Disney Renaissance and 90's Disney, movies like ""The Lion King,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""Aladdin"" are always mentioned; this one is rarely ever brought up. This movie is just as much of a classic as those!!! There was even going to be a third film set in either the Amazon or Africa but because of the death of Eva Gabor, the project was cancelled. It has all elements of true Disney: action, suspense, and drama!!! It was just re-released on Blu-Ray/DVD with the original so if you haven't seen this, check it out (especially if you're a Disney fan). Rating: 9/10!!!"
31,The Rescuers Down Under,7,23 August 2012,"Not as good as first, but entertaining","""The Rescuers Down Under"" takes Miss Bianca and Bernard to the Outback of Australia. There they must rescue a boy from the clutches of an evil poacher named McLeach. McLeach uses the child as an unknowing guide to the nest of an eagle and its eggs. Can they save the boy and keep the poacher from killing the great eagle and her offspring? Unlike its predecessor, this sequel carries an obvious statement against the hunting and killing of animals. It's still an action-packed thrill ride and very humorous even with an agenda. I think every animated film in the early 1990s needed a purpose and reason to exist.Hungarian actress Eva Gabor voices Miss Bianca with all the sophistication and panache she was known for. Bob Newhart brings Bernard to life with his trademark quiet and indifferent vocalization. John Candy gives a comical performance as the bumbling albatross Wilbur. George C. Scott sounds as malevolent as I'm sure Disney allowed him to as McLeach."
32,The Rescuers Down Under,10,3 May 2015,Firefiles Sequence,"Jake, Bianca, and Bernard are riding on the fireflies to find Cody anywhere in Australia. But, Bernard is making funny of the firefly on backwards, sneezed with the powdered flower, and splashed on water. In fact, Bianca loves to ride on the firefly. It was fun. But, the fireflies came from around the world. I know they are fun riding of the horses in the west by America. I hope it will enjoy it for that. I always love it. Bernard and Bianca are good team for the Rescue Aid Society. Anyway, it's just that they want it to rescue. This is swell. And then, you need it. Enjoy the cowboy, the merry-go-round, and the carnival rides. In the place you'll see the fireflies sequence from ""The Rescuers Down Under"" and you'll get it. Thanks for everything."
33,The Rescuers Down Under,8,28 December 2014,A really great movie that's being more overlooked than it's underwhelming prequel,"Yeah, I know the Nostalgia Critic already said something similar, but, I couldn't agree with him more. The animation is BEYOND beautiful, the actors and voice acting is great, I can't believe people remember the underwhelming prequel more than this piece of art. I mean, okay, the story's nothing special, a kid rescues a bird from a poacher's trap, the poacher gets onto the kid, he holds him hostage until he spills out where she is, and the rescuers have to save him. Okay, fine, I won't disagree with you. The plot is an overall average. But aside from that, the suspenseful sequences and action scenes REALLY make the plot stand out more. It's sequences and animation and just everything that pops up on the screen is really the icing of the cake here. The prequel, on the other hand, has none of that. It's animation was average, the action sequences weren't that exciting, the score from that movie also didn't help at all. In fact, that's another really great thing about this movie: Bruce Broughton's score. It's epic, it's adventurous, it's like the John Williams' Superman score of Disney movies. The score from the first movie never really stood out that much, and you never really noticed it was there, and, I know I'll probably get a lot of hate mail for this, but, thank GOD there were no songs in Bruce's score. Yeah, no offense, but, I've never really been that big on Disney songs. Again, that's just me, and if you like them, go ahead and continue to enjoy them. So, in conclusion, it's much better than the first movie, and if you didn't like the first movie that much, then watch this one to make up for it. You'll be a BILLION times satisfied watching this movie."
34,The Rescuers Down Under,10,4 May 2014,Underrated? Seriously?,"Most of the animated Disney sequels stink: Fox and the Hound 2, Hunchback of Notre Dame 2, Return to Neverland, Return to the Sea, and so on. So far this is the only animated Disney sequel that is a combo of thrilling and awesome, and has a decent story!I grew up watching this movie and didn't realize at first that this was a sequel to another movie. When I finally did see the first movie I liked it, but rescuing a girl from a diamond mine and riding a swamp mobile didn't feel as exciting as riding on a giant eagle, being kidnapped and threatened by a poacher with a giant lizard, getting chased a lot, exploring the outback, and almost being fed to crocodiles! Not to say that the previous adventure was dull, it wasn't - it was very dark - but this sequel had more excitement, adventure, and exploring. Plus the two mice are entering a whole new environment. The music always gets me excited, the backgrounds are awesome, and the entire story made me wish I was there! I wanted to fly on the eagle, I wanted to escape with mice, I wanted to be with talking animals, and I wanted to face all the intense adventures! It honestly surprises me that people overlook this movie. Sure it's not a musical/no princess/no cute animals (or not as cute as others), but it's not suppose to have any of those. It's just a fun adventure to watch and experience. Rent it out on DVD and give it at least one viewing; it is worth it!"
35,The Rescuers Down Under,9,17 March 2014,One of my all time favorite animated movies,"Not just one of my all time favorite Disney movies, but as stated in the summary, it is one of my favorites in terms of animated movies in general (and well-worthy of being one of the best out there).I need to get the whole box office ridiculousness out of the way first though. Basically, this movie was released at exactly the same time as Home Alone (which I don't really care for) causing Disney to pull the plug on all advertising and marketing within the first week of the movie's release, causing it to suffer in the box office, but still managed to go ""well"" over its budget.Which is unfortunate because at the start of the movie, it begins with one of the greatest animated openings of all time by having a fast moving ground-flight simulation through a field of computer animated flowers which SOUNDS simple but when you actually see it and hear the music along with it (the composer is freaking brilliant in this movie), it gets you really excited for the whole movie and that's what the whole movie is: excitement and it never does it too often, it knows how to slow down for the viewers and the entire tone of the movie is never too childish (which is also great considering it's a G-rated movie). It's seemingly for everyone.The voice acting is fantastic (one of John Candy's best roles in his final years), whoever hired these people (minus the two mice, the main characters, that's a given that they'd be in this sequel) seemed to really care and pay attention to how well they'd fit in with this movie. Everything works, everything clicks together, the music, the voices, the characters... It's such a great film and after you've seen it once, you'll want to see it again and again and again.My only gripe with this movie is that (and it's not even really a big one) is that you have to ""assume"" that the animals that were captured by the villain were saved at the end which I suppose is fair considering we don't see the child's return to his mother which is another thing we must assume as well. But in a way, this could be considered a good thing, had it taken the same route by having a similar ending to the first by showing the after math of the rescue, it wouldn't have left the viewers with that sort of hyper-ventilating sensation after watching such an exciting movie (seriously, the ending is great too).I'd give it a 9 out of 10. Even after 24 years, it still holds up. One of the greats in terms of animation."
36,The Rescuers Down Under,7,13 March 2014,Adventurous rescue sequel from Disney!,"This is a sequel to the adventurous ""The Rescuers"" from Disney, a story about two mice named Bernard and Miss Bianca from the Rescue Aid Society out to rescue a boy named Cody and his golden eagle friend Marahute from kidnapping poacher, Percival McLeach, in Australia. He is after the endangered species bird for its profitable quarry. As a result, the rescuing Bernard and Bianca team up with the society's local field operative, Jake The Kangaroo Rat, to find Cody, stop McLeach and save Marahute. This movie, Disney's 29th full-length animated feature film and the only such film to be a sequel, is like a daring and fun action-adventure movie, but with animals serving as the protagonists. It's non-stop adventure from Cody freeing Marahute to Bernard and Miss Bianca going through rushing waters to rescue Cody. All the characters, especially the critters, are lovable and memorable. The subplot of Cody and his newly-formed friendship with the eagle he rescued is interwoven into the main plot very well, expanding on the ""Rescuers"" topic of the movie.This movie, like its prequel, is probably one of the more obscure of Disney films as it does not utilize the fairytale method. I personally like ""The Rescuers"" more because I thought it was more charming and heartfelt and contained more unforgettable songs. But, this movie is nonetheless one of the more exciting Disney features that would sure delight an audience of all ages.Grade B"
37,The Rescuers Down Under,8,26 December 2008,An entertaining Disney delight,"I saw this movie again today and I still can't understand why this movie became forgotten. I think it's unfair that ""The Rescuers Down Under"" didn't get the attention ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" got. Don't get me wrong, I liked those movies too, but ""The Rescuers Down Under"" truly deserved to be among the 90's golden age (I know it's sounds like a cliché, but it's true).This movie opens with a breathtaking, opening shot where the camera swoops over the Australian outback, which is alone worth the watch. One could think the movie would fail from there on, but fortunately it never does. After the prologue the movie offers a high paced action, adventure and humor that will get the kids amused - or a least it amused me when I saw this film at theaters as a child. The character animation is great and the movie's visual look is beautiful and certainly realistic. I loved the layout and the epic scale. And Bruce Broughtons score is majestic as well.While the story is quite simple, the characters portrays good personalities. My favorites are Wilbur, Jake, Frank, and Joanna. The fact that the latter character didn't speak made her more amusing. McLeach is a effective villain and Bernard and Bianca are two likable protagonists. And Marahute provides great majesty.I remember seeing this film for the first time as a 7-year old in theaters - it was an amusing and spectacular experience. Several years have passed and I'm still enjoying it. Although the film's ingredients are enough to please the kids, I still think the action and excitement of would fit to the adults too. It's a film that nobody should miss and deserves to be everyone's childhood memory (or in a adult's memory, for that matter)."
38,The Rescuers Down Under,8,11 April 2006,overall impressive,"I found this film to be visually stunning and it was obvious the a lot of research had gone into the locations and animal movements used in this film.I was however disappointed that two of the key characters, who were supposed to be Australian, had American accents. It really spoiled the film for me. Considering the fact that the were both supposed to be Australian this really bugged me throughout the duration of the film. Aside from this, the accents of the supporting cast were excellent.Although it had a few voice issues, this film is very impressive overall. It is well paced, and has a lovely message behind it, ""that even if you are small, you can make a difference for the better,"" and I thoroughly recommend giving it a go, especially younger viewers."
39,The Rescuers Down Under,,22 February 2003,Something's missing,"It had been about ten years or more since I had last watched the sequel to the classic 'Rescuers,' so I checked it out, not expecting it to be better, but at least good.It -was- good (but not as good as the original of course), and the CGI imagery really was impressive at the time, though it's already looking dated. However, I felt there were a few holes in this movie. For one thing, why doesn't Cody have an Australian accent? His mom does. And why didn't they show his mom being ecstatic when she realizes her boy's all right? Maybe they just figured you knew it was going to happen, but it would have been great to see.All in all, this is far, far superior to the tons of Disney sequels coming out, but it doesn't live up to the original. But I do suggest you check this one out if you're fond of the original 'Rescuers.'"
40,The Rescuers Down Under,3,23 September 2011,This should have gone direct to video,"The Rescuers is one of my favorite Disney films of all time. It's subtle, beautiful, and sweet. So that's why it irks me that this movie even exists. But what irks me more is that this movie is so completely inept at even the basics of decent storytelling, which is saying a lot considering the company it came from. But what really gets me, well not furious but pretty mad, is that people actually think this is better than the original. But I'll get to that.The movie begins with Cody, a typical little boy living in the middle of absolutely nowhere who can talk to the animals with no real explanation as to how. We learn that he lost his father. And that's it, folks, the only character development we get from this character! We see him learn nothing or change in any way, he remains the same completely bland character throughout the whole movie. We're also given no explanation as to why he has an American accent when he clearly lives in the middle of the Australian Outback. Was he born in America and moved to Australia when his dad disappeared from existence with no explanation? Ah well, he gets trapped by a poacher and we're treated to 72 minutes of environmentalist agenda. But never mind that, we then get to see our main characters.And, unfortunately, they play a minor role in the movie, despite the fact they're in the title of the film. The running gag is that Bernard is trying to propose to Bianca, a pretty weak gag if you ask me. Then they go flying with what has to be the most annoying character the Disney animators of the Renaissance ever put on screen: Wilbur the albatross. And he never leaves. His subplot is never funny or necessary and it just made me very uncomfortable watching him get shot with a giant needle.And then Cody is trapped with a few characters who appear for, I guess, comic relief, but are left to rot down there because they're never shown again. Thus making that scene completely pointless. The other stupid thing in this movie is that, in the end, Bernard is standing on a weak branch holding a rope that is supporting Cody and keeping him from being washed away in a raging river. Now I know this is a cartoon but give me a break, a mouse couldn't possibly be that strong.The only thing this entire movie has is visuals. There's no denying that it's a beautiful movie. The scenery is breathtaking. But I still think it isn't as good as the first film, which was a bit more like a gorgeous watercolor painting. But I think that's more of a matter of taste because while I may prefer the subtly of the first film, you might prefer the more realistic and gorgeous Australian scenery this film offers and I think both are equally as good. But that's about all that's good about this movie.This movie looks like a good one on the surface but if you actually see it, it's clear there's nothing else to offer. Better than the original? I don't think so. This is one of the worst sequels to a REALLY good movie that I have ever seen. Skip this and watch The Rescuers. And if you're unimpressed by this, still watch The Rescuers to see how telling a story about two heroic mice is REALLY done."
41,The Rescuers Down Under,,24 January 2004,Outback Trailblazer,"Here is Disney at war with itself.  Yes, the animals talk, there are the usual stereotypes in the artwork, and there is a general lack of artistry. However, this can be seen as a definite link in Disney's chain.  I chart Disney's progress as such:1. The formulaic work of Disney himself.2. The post-Disney 80s where inventiveness took over.3. The emergence of the 'Little Mermaid' and its formula.4. The rise of Pixar.This 'Rescuers' is the most interesting effort at bridging the gap between levels 3 and 4.  By today's standards, post-'Nemo', the computer animation is antiquated, the voice acting (Candy in particular) is daft, and the script is simple.Nonetheless, this is Disney trying to break the very stereotypes it and Don Bluth created.  This is Disney trying to be Ralph Bakshi, that is the most daring I can say of their work so far.  Pixar has changed Disney for the better and here's where it all started.Disney's style relies on three ingredients: exaggeration, nature, and monochrome colors.  We have the typical characters (the titular 'Rescuers') and then we their opposite: the eagle.  More effort is gone into making it look, sound, and act like a natural construction instead of the usual unreal cartoon that this element alone makes it a worthwhile excursion.  I would compare it to most of 'Bambi' and the first few minutes of 'Lion King'. Compare the eagle to Wilbur to see the level of detail.The biggest innovation of all: flight.  After spending 60 years stuck on the ground relying on entertaining the viewer with simple visual pieces reminiscent of stage plays (one aspect of how Disney took our viewing minds backwards as children), the first half of 'Rescuers II' is totally worth viewing just for the attempt at three-dimensional thinking by Disney animators.  The detail in 'Rescuers II' isn't comparable to 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Aladdin', but it relies on the Bakshi tradition of taking art from life, not vice-versa.Overall, 'Winnie the Pooh' meets 'Catch-22'Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."
42,The Rescuers Down Under,4,5 September 2003,Wouldn't recommend it even to a 6 year-old,"Just fairly decent animation, mediocre and poorly used voice talents, a bad story, lack of side-kick humor and humor altogether(grown-up humor, that is), a horribly evil and unfunny villain, and unbelievable scenes that almost defy even the laws of animation ...need I go on. Disney is rarely this unbalanced and unfunny, and what's up with the Australian boy speaking with an American accent. The likes of the greatest animation studio in the world shouldn't afford such blatant mistakes. This animated movie definitely isn't for teenagers, let alone adults, but it's much too dark and includes a really evil bad guy to make the younger audience appreciate it. ""The Rescuers Down Under"" is a poor and uneven cartoon that makes me further understand why Pixar is and probably will be so successful. They're able to make both the young ones and adults have a blast. Don't think I'll give the original one, ""The Rescuers"" a chance. 4/10"
43,The Rescuers Down Under,,26 October 2003,True,The best Disney film I've seen.For me Frank the frilled Lizard was the best charecter and is my favorite Disney charecter! I really liked the animation and the voices really suited the charecters.
44,The Rescuers Down Under,10,9 October 2017,Why can't Disney make more sequels like this?,"This is a beautiful movie. That's it. And what's more astounding is the fact that it is a Disney sequel. Why couldn't the most famous and revolutionary animation company make more like this instead of those crappy direct-to-video sequel they are so infamous for? Enough complaining. Why is this movie so good? It was one of their first movies with fully CG-animated backgrounds and it is flawless. The flight scenes with Cody and the golden eagle are also amazing beyond all. And when the real mission begins, it is a full-blown action-adventure movie with tons of great action scenes.The new characters are a lot of fun, especially the new albatross, Wilbur, voiced by the always funny John Candy. He has several scenes in which he made me laugh hard! The villain, Percival McLeach, is just as underrated as Medusa in the first movie. He is voiced by the great George C. Scott, who truly understands making him menacing. His pet, Joanna, is also a good and funny sidekick.There are a few aspects of the movie I must underline, though. The first of them being the characters in Australia, who are mostly serving the plot, but there are some who are rather pointless and only in it for a short time. The other being that the Rescuers themselves. They are not bad, but I do not see it as a good sign when a movie could be just as good without their main characters. Maybe it is a little harsh to say, because Bernard and Miss Bianca have great interactions. It is just a notice. The movie is still criminally underrated and deserves more attention."
45,The Rescuers Down Under,9,17 August 2017,Probably the best sequel I have ever witnessed!,"Sometimes franchises don't start with excellent first installments and The Rescuers is definitively one of them. To put it in one word, The Rescuers is too straight forward in story telling. The plot is good, but they could have added so much more to make it a rich and spicy tale. For example: Bianca chose to go on a mission with a concierge instead with someone that was meant for the task and that is uh... fine, but no further consequences after that. Bernard seems to have no struggle in doing such a complex job. In fact Bernard was rather really cut out for this job, which surprised me. There is also no conservation afterwards like 'Hey, Bianca why did you choose me over all the potential companions that were cut out for this job.', which was really a shame. There was also a lack of romance between Bianca and Bernard(only a nice compliment here and there), until The Rescuers Down Under was released:Not only they have managed to add the necessarily romance it needed: Bernard is going to marry Bianca. They also add comical events which I truly missed in the first film. Sure some of it was childish like the frilled lizard, but also humor that really works on the older audience, like Bernard's first attempt to ask Bianca to marry back in that restaurant and that little misunderstanding with Bianca afterwards. That is just clever writing. Some of the humor in this film was just simply hilarious, especially the egg stealing scene at the poacher's home and that is just the bit of spice the first installment really needed. Not only they add spice by humor, they even add a subplot: 'Safe the eagle', which was really a rich addition. They also add small and good looking features like the R.A.S. relay(in the very beginning), a chandelier as a restaurant, Riding wild animals. All these things, makes it dynamic. This is probably the biggest difference between the two, because the sphere in the first movie was darker, which was not too bad, but TRDU looks a lot more alive and you can see that every minute is well organized, this probably explains also why the film has no songs. Yes, The Rescuers Down Under is a sequel that contains NO songs. Do not get me wrong, I love songs, but they are often mediocre written and they are mostly just a filler for the movie. The sequels of 'The Land before Time' are the main offenders of this, but in this case it is rather the opposite. The Rescuers did not contain many songs, but they were fillers.The ending was rather abrupt in TRDU, but it did not felt needed, In fact I sometimes prefer this way of ending it, because it gives you an opportunity to decide for yourself in how they will life happily ever after. In conclusion: TRDU is the prime example of an excellent sequel, maybe even the best that I have ever witnessed. To put it in one word: underrated!"
46,The Rescuers Down Under,8,3 August 2017,Disney's First Sequel: An Underrated Masterpiece,"For some reason, The Rescuers Down Under is overlooked as one of the great Disney films from its renaissance period. I presume because its a sequel to an earlier film. This film has an entirely different tone and atmosphere than the original. This a pure adventure film in the rugged Australian outback and a very breathtaking adventure film at that. Lots of daring and thrilling camera shots and angles throughout; Most of them in the early sequence when Cody frees the eagle from a trap. It's been said that these scenes were inspired by Miyazaki's films such as Nausicaa and Castle in the Sky, which were out at the time of production.What's remarkable about the cast is that all the characters that appear in this film that appeared in the original are voiced by the same voice actors. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprise their roles as Bernard and Bianca respectively. Bernard Fox reprises the role of the Chairmouse, a minor character. Since Jim Jordan, who voiced Oroville, had passed away in 1988, a new albatross was created named Wilbur, brother to Oroville. John Candy was an excellent choice for Wilbur. Otherwise, all the other characters are new. George C. Scott gives the best performance as the villain Percival McCleach. He's a menacing but entertaining villain, surprisingly underrated. (I've been a big fan of Scott's rough gravely voice).Surprisingly, this was released on video before the original was. I remember seeing this one first. Most of us that were born around this time would remember this one well.The film still holds up strongly today and deserves a status as one of the great Disney classics."
47,The Rescuers Down Under,,26 May 2001,Superior to the original,"I may be in the minority on this, I don't know, but I felt this film was superior to the 1977 original, which I found fairly disappointing. Besides fluid, lush animation, solid depictions of native wildlife, hilarious performance by John Candy, awe-inspiring scenes of an eagle in flight and one of Disney's best villains ever, McLeach (voice of George C. Scott, he of Dr. Strangelove and Patton fame - you just can't beat that) there is one outstanding feature of this film - nobody breaks out in song! (Sword in the Stone stands out for this reason, as well)  Now, I like a good Disney musical as well as anyone else but the key word is 'good,' (and I'm just judging the musical aspect of any given Disney movie when I say that) something Disney hasn't produced in a looooong while.  Mediocre?  Yes. Bad? Hell yes!  But Good, no; not since Jungle Book has Disney produced an outstanding musical feature.  But this film dispenses with the tradition altogether and just concentrates on the characters and fast-paced and highly entertaining story.  The only minor fault I have with this film is that the kid didn't have a local accent; it was strangely flat for someone from Down Under.  Other than that, top marks."
48,The Rescuers Down Under,,9 September 2002,Lacks the simple charm of the earlier Disney film...,"Aside from the wider use of special effects to simulate soaring flights over land and sea and some very realistic computer generated camerawork, THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER doesn't compare favorably in story and characters to the earlier Disney film, THE RESCUERS ('77).For one thing, the principals Bernard and Miss Bianca don't enter the film until twenty minutes of exposition pass. The little boy in no way draws the kind of sympathy or involvement in his plight that the rescued Penny did in the original film. He's a mere cypher and we know next to nothing about him. The film is apparently designed as an impressive showcase for computerized animation techniques.The trouble is that despite the gimmicky effects, the story content is not only slim but unappealing, dealing as it does with an unappetizing poacher (George C. Scott) and his cohorts in a plan to get rich at the expense of wildlife.  Scott's voice is well used for the character but fails to combine the wickedness with the broad sense of humor we usually have in Disney villains.  He does have a few humorous asides but nothing memorable except for lines like ""I didn't go all the way through third grade for nothing.""Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart are again on hand as the voice talent for Miss Bianca and Bernard. John Candy's fans will enjoy his wildly humorous stint as Wilbur the albatross. But the animation is on a lower level than the original as far as the characters are concerned, with more emphasis on the brilliant backgrounds and soaring movements that are real enough to stir up some motion sickness after awhile. Some of the most humorous moments in the film are supplied by Joanna, the cunning lizard used and abused by Scott's character. Although the film doesn't duplicate the charm of the original, children will probably love its sense of adventure and the boy's soaring flights over canyons and rivers on the back of an eagle. Does not rank among the great Disney films but children will probably find it engrossing enough."
49,The Rescuers Down Under,5,15 July 2006,It's not that bad...,"...but it doesn't compare to the original. Compared to the Pixar films however, this is a masterpiece, and even compared to The Little Mermaid it's pretty good.What annoys me most about this movie is how it portrays Australia. How Australia is portrayed is way off. Sure, the centre of Australia is a desert, there are lakes full of crocodiles, violent storms and high cliffs. But there are not giant eagles, there are not houses right near Uluru/Ayer's Rock (because it's in a national park and people aren't allowed to live in national parks), and people do not speak like an American trying to put on an Australian accent or use the word 'mom'. I suppose it's because I live in Australia that I can pick up these errors, but really, most of the stuff shown about Australia in the movie is just not true."
50,The Rescuers Down Under,,16 December 2006,Down Under with the World's Two Bravest Mice,"First thing's first, if you know the history of Disney's animated features, then you know a little about what Disney was going through when they made the original Rescuers. They were dealing with lackluster animated films, which they weren't able to produce more than 3 or so per decade since the 1950's. The '60s were very hard, especially with the failing health and eventual death of Walt Disney, but they managed to come out on top with The Jungle Book. But the '70s were a different story. Both 1970's The Aristocats and 1973's Robin Hood were not met with even close to the same success of '60s hits Jungle and 101 Dalmatians. So of course, if Disney's latest investment, 1977's The Rescuers, weren't able to work out- it was pretty clear they would have to make another Mary Poppins / Bedknobs and Broomsticks blockbuster (which would be the disastrous Pete's Dragon) and hope their feature-length Winnie the Pooh package film would pick up the slack.However, The Rescuers was a hit with audiences and critics (becoming one of their most successful films, animated or non, of the decade). And there's a pretty obvious reason for that. The story was very touching, the characters were one of a kind, and the movie itself when it came together, had everything. Humor, tears, excitement. It was a perfect Disney film. So, really, a sequel to this film was never actually a very good idea. Because in this film, we see the filmmakers trying to replace everything in the original. And they're only able to be second rate in their attempts. Penny the orphan from the first movie is replaced by a little boy, Cody, who's not an orphan but a little explorer / animal activist. In the original film, when Penny needed the mice to save her, she says quite plainly - ""how can two little mice save me (from these villains)?"" And that was important. But in this film, there's none of that. Though there are some unbelievable scenes where one of the mice (or even 3) are able to hold little Cody's weight just by holding onto a rope. Sorry, but that's impossible. No wonder there was never a line in the movie about ""2 little mice,"" because then everyone would have laughed because this is ridiculous.The original villain, Medusa, is replaced by another greedy baddie, Percival C. McLeach. So, 2 little mice can save us from greed... Why is it always a greedy thief? Because Bernard and Bianca can't handle international terrorists? Or Michael Jackson? The other 3 original villains, Snoops and the 2 crocodiles, are replaced here by 1 villain, a salamander named Joanna, who's probably the cutest character here. I'm not kidding- just watch that scene where she swims out of the river and waves 'goodbye' to McLeach. The original Albatross, Orville, is replaced here by Wilbur- which was just an excuse to hire John Candy, who had huge success with his classic '80s John Hughes family comedy, Uncle Buck. And right here is a good example of where the movie goes horribly wrong. Wilbur arrives in Australia, injures his back, then the movie goes for a 4+ minute sequence (split into two) with a bunch of mice ""operating"" on him while he is flopping around and wailing. Does that sound appealing... to anyone?So anyway, bottom line - I think this film was meant more for the audiences who prefer blander fare like those Don Bluth films. But for Disney, this has absolutely none of that great Disney magic that films like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid were able to recapture from Disney's stagnant, stumbling '80s. The one saving grace here is the incorporation of computer animated technology. Now, usually, I cry foul and whip CGI every chance I get. But about this time, Disney began their collaboration with Pixar to make animated films with some obvious computer-generated backgrounds so they could have sequences like several of the ones in this movie, where the movie functions as a roller-coaster ride (most notably the opening credits sequence where the camera SPEEDS through a field of some kind of flower, and a couple of Wilbur's great flying scenes). Now, that's magical, if not exciting and great fun.But with this sequel, we lose all of what made the first great - the true danger, empathizing with the lonely orphan, and the whole idea of seeing a character's darkest hour and journey, so when we finally see their brighter day, it really feels as though they triumphed. All we get in return is some dull humor, the end of Bernard and Bianca's romantic saga, and a cool golden eagle with some very polarizing Eggs in Distress action. I say it polarized because the movie was so predictable, I was wishing the whole time we would either see the eggs hatch and go ""aaaahhhh"" (code for ""isn't that cute?"") or see Joanna the villain get to actually eat the eggs. Most of the time, I wanted to see Joanna get her UNjust desserts- which speaks to just how boring this is for a Disney movie. I say- skip it."
51,The Rescuers Down Under,,30 September 2002,CARTOON INDIANA JONES,"seriously. this is like Indy kiddie-fied. nothing against Dr. Jones by any means i've worn those 3 out over and over again. but this is one the best SEQUELS of any kind ever. it so outdoes the original it isn't even funny. plus this is the 1st Disney movie that was ever bought for me at the tender age of 10 ( a milestone in it's own right) one of the best voice casting jobs ever! Newhart and Gabor are top notch just as they were 13 years earlier. George C. Scott is the cartoon villain dreams are made of. and the true highlight along with the character of Frank is the late, great John Candy. i adore the work of this man even today some 8 or 9 years since his passing and he was hilarious as always in this one. watch it! i hadn't watched it in years it set in the closet shelf collecting dust but if you have it break it out of wherever you've hid it and enjoy it again.thanks!"
52,The Rescuers Down Under,7,15 March 2015,"A visually refined sequel, albeit one with unfulfilled potential","Often overlooked amongst the giants of the 90's Disney era, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" has enjoyed a more than modest following in the decades since. It's easy to see why, given its relatively unique quality within the infamous pool of Disney sequels. Yet, even with all its successes (and it is a successful movie), I can still understand why it was quickly forgotten.The main assets are, as anyone who has seen it has noticed, the impressive production values. Unlike the original, which felt much more old-fashioned and subdued in its style, the images and characters have a much smoother and more detailed look, and the movement is more fluid. It would be an understatement to say that this is a very good looking movie. Most are quick to point out the flying scenes when discussing this (fittingly so), although I think it is unfair to heap so much praise on a film because of one early sequence. There is an equally impressive scene, where the 3 mice attempt to infiltrate Mcleach's vehicle and the ""camera"" goes through one long shot throughout the mechanisms of the vehicle. Some of the animals, particularly Marahute and Joanna, are remarkably life-like and expressive, far more so than the occasionally amusing, mostly annoying local critters cursed with voices.As far as voice performances go, Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor remain at the top of their game as Bernard and Ms. Bianca, bringing an endearing quality that is welcome. Adam Ryen makes a decent effort to bring life to the new ""child in distress"", Cody, though his inhuman bravery can be bothersome; Penny brought the correct blend of bravery and child-like vulnerability to the screen. However, John Candy is wrong for the role of Wilbur, the albatross. His voice is too recognizable, a fact not helped by the slew of rapid fire lines the script gives him.The standout, though, is definitely George C. Scott as Percival Mcleach, one of the few elements with which the sequel made a definite improvement. He is completely in control of every scene he is in, bringing a degree of menace that befits his role as an almost obsessive poacher, but also displaying wit and cunning; pay attention to his endlessly amusing double act with Joanna. Mcleach really is the main reason to watch this movie, and perhaps the most fully realized individual therein.There are two not insignificant faults that ultimately prevent this from being an improvement over its predecessor: the story and treatment of the characters. Regardless of what anyone says regarding any other aspect of ""The Rescuers Down Under"", it is undeniable that the story is wafer-thin, and more befitting of an hour long television special than a feature film. At its bare bones, it is simply a retread of that of ""The Rescuers"", with the mice getting a distress call to rescue a child that has been kidnapped because the kidnapper needs the child in order to obtain something valuable. The difference is that ""The Rescuers"" actually had a sense of significance, at least in its own line, because it was the first mission for the two main mice. With the exception of Bernard's plans to propose (which deserved much more focus), this story feels more like an ordinary chapter in these guys' lives. The flow is also problematic, as the choppy middle act tries to juggle 3 subplots, 2 of which are little more than distractions, and none of which give us much reason to care for the key players.This matter is only exacerbated by how the characters are handled this time around. While I very much liked the two lead mice, it only left me all the more let down by the fact that they have very little to do here. Unlike ""The Rescuers"", where they actively investigate, plan and discuss the situation, Ms. Bianca and Bernard's part in the story is told in broad strokes. With the exception of the climax, their story mostly amounts to getting from point A to point B, showing the bare minimum of what they go through. There is a nice subplot with Bernard planning to propose to Bianca, but constantly being interrupted; this made for a few engaging moments, particularly one where the two of them are briefly alone together before a snake appears. The movie really needed more moments like this where the relationship between these two could truly be conveyed. Bianca, who once served as an active encouraging influence for Bernard, now mainly has the purpose of looking cute; she is no longer the kind of character that acts. Also, given that they are clearly in a relationship, am I the only one bothered by her seeming indifference to Bernard being relegated to a third-wheel half the time? Nonetheless, it was satisfying to see Bernard step out of his comfort zone and work out the situation, even if it feels obligatory and rushed.While The Rescuers Down Under is a commendable, and quite funny, effort at continuing the story of an older Disney film, it falls a little short of its predecessor. Today, there seems to be a growing number of people that claim it was underrated during the time of its release. I will admit to that, but it was not to a considerable degree. In fact, I would go so far as to say that these same people give it too much credit. There was plenty to behold in the visual department, but not enough to make me care beyond a superficial level, a stark weakness when its contemporaries aspired to considerable emotional resonance."
53,The Rescuers Down Under,10,4 May 2013,the exception that proves the rule!,"this sequel is a recipe for a disaster when you think about it: sequel to a movie that was a bit forgettable, characters are not as memorable as in other Disney movies. out of all 30 Disney sequels, this is the only tolerable one (excluding pixar movies). animation: top notch, i don't think i have ever seen anything smoother. plot: simple yet sufficient. characters: they added a crocodile Dundee like guy (who is the only one with the correct accent). they replaced the slightly annoying girl with a stronger boy, that makes a difference as you can see he can take care of himself(ish). the villain is very threatening and a bit realistic and not completely over the top as in the prequel. the plot is similar in the way that the villain needs something from the child, but i found that the second was better as there the villain needs the location of a bird that the child is fondly attached to, which gives a more threatening climax, as at the same time, the viewers don't know the limits of the two characters, and how far they will go to achieve. in the prequel, the girl has to get a diamond and then she is basically free, (as one would notice near the end of the movie). in the sequel, lets say it gets quite a bit more intense.the main reason people don't like it is because it isn't true to the original. to be honest, i found the original a bit slow paced and in some areas it literally lacked some animation mainly in that flying scene. found the plot in the original weaker in some ways, and has a few unnecessary details. i found the little girl with her teddy very irritating with all those cutesy moments. i did find the two songs relaxing but again, very forgettable.in conclusion, the sequel is superior to the original in many ways. This movie might be too intense for children under 5. if they haven't seen it, then this is a must.this movie would be interesting to see in 3d, as it would have quite a few moments when some depth could be interesting."
54,The Rescuers Down Under,,3 April 2013,Decent Sequel,"The Rescuers Down Under (1990) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to the 1977 film has an Australian boy being kidnapped by a poacher because he learns that the kid knows the location of a golden eagle and its eggs. Soon the Rescue Aid Society are informed and both Bernard and Bianca are on their way. THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER was considered a major flop when it was first released and I must admit that it's somewhat shocking that Disney would select THE RESCUERS as a film to make a sequel to. Not that the original film is bad but there's certainly many better known titles out there that they could have done a sequel to and I'm sure they would have gone over better with crowds. Either way, this film isn't nearly as good as the original and I think this is mainly due to the story here not being all that good. We've got the same concept of what we saw in the original but the biggest change is that we're now in Australian, which I'm sure was in response to CROCODILE DUNDEE being such a hit. There are a few things that really work here including an amazing opening sequence where the boy ends up on the back of the eagle and goes for an incredibly fun journey through the clouds. If the rest of the film had more scenes like this one then it would have been much better. I also thought that the animation was great but then again you expect this from Disney. Both Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor are good reprising their roles and we get John Candy and George C. Scott doing fine work as well. THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER is far from a bad movie but it never quite reaches the level of the first film, which wasn't a classic either."
55,The Rescuers Down Under,7,29 December 2011,Impressive as long as the political message wasn't bias,"This was a sequel to my surprise. Wasn't expecting to see the two mice again. I was impressed with the story and enjoyed the characters. The only thing I disliked was the fact that they seemed to be implying that man is evil and kills animals. The political message was annoying but as long as they only meant it in the way that FEW men are evil then I'm okay with that.The story itself was funny. I was hoping that the mouse could propose to the female mouse, and it was funny seeing it implied that the tour guide may be getting the the girl, but the proposal in the end, while rushed was still great. And of course the comedic humor with the bird as the plane is always wonderful!Rated 7/10"
56,The Rescuers Down Under,7,12 October 2006,Bernard and Bianca Head to the Outback Down Under  to One-Up the Bad Guys!,"Our adventure picks up where our last never left off: the Australian outback. On this fine day, Cody, a young, adventurous boy, discovers a very large, beautiful eagle caught in a poacher's trap. Using his skill, Cody worked quickly to save the eagle and so sparked an instantaneous friendship. On the eagle's back, Cody soared high over the plains and valleys of the world's smallest continent. He was king of the world. The eagle took Cody to her nest and showed him her eggs. She was a mother eagle. The father eagle, though, was sadly killed by a poacher. On his way home, Cody stopped to help a field mouse caught in another trap when suddenly he himself fell into a larger trap. And then, who should come along but Percival C. McLeach, the gruffest, meanest, nastiest poacher in all of Australia and possibly the world. Roaring up in his giant monster truck, he was surprised to find a young human in his trap. He helped Cody out and suddenly noticed the golden eagle feather on his person. Immediately McLeach demanded to know where the feather's owner was. Cody refused to blab, so McLeach threw him in the back slammer and drove off. The field mouse quickly got on the telegraph and sent a message for help. But there was only one agency who could provide the proper rescue aid: The Rescue Aid Society.The message bounced from the Hawaiian islands, across the U.S.A until it finally reached RAS headquarters in the basement of the U.N. building in New York. The RAS Chairman called an emergency meeting in which all the delegates attended...except for its two top agents: Bernard and Miss Bianca who, at that very moment, were dining atop a chandelier in a fancy restaurant across town. Bernard was trying to get up the courage to propose to Miss Bianca, but that's when they received the message to get down to Australia and rescue the kidnapped boy. They decide to fly, much to Bernard's chagrin, on Albatross Air again. Instead of Orville, they meet his outrageous, but obnoxious twin brother Wilbur. After a very long flight, the trio arrive in Australia and the landing left Wilbur literally bent out of shape, so they took him to a field hospital aboard an old Army bus, while Bernard and Bianca meet a wily, kangaroo-mouse named Jake, who took an immediate shine to Miss Bianca. Together, they make their move into the vast, ferocious deserts of Australia's outback, all the while Jake tries to put the moves on Bianca by showing her what a good snake wrangler he was. Meanwhile, McLeach, determined to find the eagle's eggs, released Cody and lied about the mother eagle being killed, knowing the boy would immediately go for the eggs. Which he did. McLeach jumped into his monster truck and gave chase. Bernard, Bianca and Jake witnessed and decided to come along, so they jump aboard the truck.Sure enough, Cody went right for the eagle's nest. Suddenly, he heard a familiar screech then saw...the eagle! She hadn't been killed. Well, not yet anyway, for right then McLeach showed up, sprang a huge trap and captured the eagle. He also caught Cody, Bianca and Jake then took off, leaving Bernard stranded in the nest. Fortunately Wilbur, having escaped the hellish mouse hospital, showed up. Bernard gave him the duty of egg-sitting, while he set off to rescue the captives and fight the bad guys. Along the way, he enlists the help of a razorback he was able to tame. Since McLeach had the eagle, he didn't need Cody anymore so he decided to stop and feed him to the crocodiles. Bianca and Jake were helpless, but luckily, just as Brutus and Nero's cousins were about to devour the boy, Bernard arrived on razorback. He quickly helped Bianca and Jake, then he bravely saved the boy from the treacherous waters and caused McLeach to fall in. Luckily for him, he avoided the crocs. He thought he was so clever, but he just didn't see that waterfall coming. The ruthless poacher went over, falling over 100 feet. It's safe to say the game of the outback won't have to worry about him anymore. Well, the friends all rejoice and take a ride on the eagle's back. Bernard finally worked up the courage to propose to Miss Bianca. She accepted. And they all lived happily ever after...The Rescuers Down Under, sequel to the 1977 Disney blockbuster The Rescuers. To be honest, I found the original to be much better. The original just blew my mind. It was spectacular. Beautiful. Full of heart. Well made. Rescuers Down Under had terrific animation, but was greatly lacking in story, plot and most of all, character development. I found Cody, Jake and McLeach to be very undeveloped. And I'd still like to know how Bernard and Bianca came about joining RAS. The characters in this one were a tad weak and not quite involved. McLeach was more cruel than Medusa, yet she still seems nastier. Penny was an absolute sweetheart, and Cody, he was a good boy, but again, undeveloped; the dynamic duo of Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor return to voice our pint-sized heroes. John Candy is Wilbur. George C. Scott is McLeach, Adam Ryen as Cody and Tristan Rogers as Jake, all delivered great performances. Gabor, Candy and Scott are gone now, but their talents shall be remembered forever. Anyway, if you're a fan of Disney and you liked The Rescuers, then by all means give The Rescuers Down Under a try, mate. From 1990, The Rescuers Down Under. I recommend it."
57,The Rescuers Down Under,7,12 August 2002,"Well, Candy steals the show","John's voice is great for animation, just like it's Bacon comerical.  He is the comic break, in a well crafted, cartoon.  It is a happy story that kids will enjoy. Notice the non adultness this movie has over many so called children films. 7/10"
58,The Rescuers Down Under,8,19 July 1999,I really wish they'd chosen another title.,"Under NO circumstances should a studio use the words `Down Under' in a title.  A quick search on this fine database revealed such monstrosities as `The Facts of Life Down Under' and `Worzel Gummidge Down Under' - THAT'S the kind of thing people think of.  (To be honest there were fewer cheesy `down under' titles than I thought there'd be - but that just shows what a turn-off it is.)I don't like to be predictable but I'm going to start by complaining about the Australian child who speaks with an American accent.  News bulletin to Hollywood: American audiences are perfectly capable of following an Australian accent; and even if they aren't, it will take them all of two minutes to learn how.Where was I?  -Oh yes, I was talking about a film.  It's actually rather good.  The kid is just a cipher anyway: everyone knows the true protagonists of the Rescuers movies are Bernard and Bianca, who are American and Hungarian respectively - no problem with the voices there.  It's a decent rescue movie, sharply paced, with animation that leaps ahead of `The Little Mermaid' (mermaid herself excepted).  The naïve computer animation will, I predict, age better than many more sophisticated attempts.  (It already has.)  There are moments of true humour.  Why, then, did this film fail at the box office?  I'll tell you why - it was the words `down' and `under' in the title."
59,The Rescuers Down Under,6,22 March 2010,decent followup,"as far as sequels go,this one was certainly no the worse ti have seen.it certainly has darker themes than the original.it's also an grander scale visually,if that makes any sense.some of the 'sweeping vista' type scenes brought to my mind The Lion King,which would not be release for another four years.it was apparent that more than the the old style animation was being used here,and it quite a stark contrast to the original film.there are no musical numbers here.and with the darker themes the peril and sense of danger is heightened.there are some funny moments in this one,though maybe not as many as the first.i think this film has more of moral to it.or at least is emphasizing that aspect of it.and there's nothing wrong with that.the only problem for me,was i didn't find the charm and warmth of the first film.it had a more intimate feel to it,which i felt this one lacked.but that's just my opinion.otherwise,it's pretty decent.for me,The Rescuers Down Under is a 6/10"
60,The Rescuers Down Under,5,5 September 2006,what we realize in later years,"Steve Irwin's tragic death two days ago brings to mind Australia, including movies set there, including this one. When I first saw ""The Rescuers Down Under"", I interpreted it as nice entertainment. I guess that when you're six years old, it is just that. But a previous reviewer noted some plot holes, namely the lack of Aussie accents. Then again, since when do Disney features shoot for realism? I mean, ""Cinderella"" portrayed an abused woman who always looked like Grace Kelly.Anyway, I take a new look at this movie when I see who did the voices (I can assure you that I didn't recognize any of these names when I was six): Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor, John Candy, George C. Scott, Frank Welker, Bernard Fox and Peter Firth. To rephrase that: Robert Hartley, Lisa Douglas, the ""Second City"" guy who became one of the famous comics of the '80s and '90s, Gen. Turgidson, miscellaneous, Dr. Bombay and another miscellaneous. Whoa...So, it's OK if we just accept it as cute entertainment for children. But don't expect a religious experience.P.S.: Happy birthday, Mr. Newhart! You were great in ""Catch-22"", ""Cold Turkey"" and ""In & Out""! P.P.S.: Why do I mention Steve Irwin, ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Bewitched"", ""Catch-22"", ""Cold Turkey"" and ""In & Out"" in a review of a Disney movie? I guess that I'm just plain weird!"
61,The Rescuers Down Under,4,3 December 2014,Silence of the Lambs for children,"I am judging movies on what they suppose to be. I know, this is a film designed to appeal to children. But I have some issues with The Rescuers Down Under.It particularly disturbed me as a child, so I would not recommend it as a children movie. Mainly because the plot itself is not very suitable for a children's movie. A mentaly unstable guy hunts animals, he is looking for rare animals to imprison them and sell them for money. And one day he finds a little boy entrapped in one of his animal traps. The boy is now a witness of his criminal activity, so he decides to kidnap him... Thats good material for a thriller or action movie  The boy gets imprisoned in an animal cage like all the animals. Silence of the Lambs 2, isn't it? He is far away from home and his family. Are you entertained yet? After all the boy manages to escape with the help of the famous two mice. In the grand finale the villain tries to feed off the little boy to wild crocodiles. Whats the lesson here for children? Be aware of psychopathic kidnappers?
Fortunatly the bad guy drowns ""by accident"". He drowns and it is over. What have we learned children? Australia is not a safe place? Be aware of kidnappers? Don't go outside. If you are lucky and a kidnapper catches you, he will have an ""accident"". If not, you may never see your family again."
62,The Rescuers Down Under,2,8 September 2006,"The makers of this film watched the first movie, but did not read Margery Sharp's books!","After having loved Disney's first adaptation of Margery Sharp's The Rescuers series, The Rescuers from 1977, I decided to give a try to one of their many unnecessary, badly done sequels. Well, I wasn't disappointed because I wasn't expecting nothing more than pure garbage and that is what I got.The makers of this film obviously watched the first movie, since the whole plot manages to completely rip-off the original's touching dramatic plot and somehow turn it into tasteless, bland, cheap comedy at the same time not managing to capture a single element from Margery Sharp's books, which the first film had done so beautifully.Not only that, but the story is unrealistic and uninteresting, too many corners are cut and it bugs me that it doesn't even bother to keep on the same style as the first film (Which was attempted in 101 Dalmatians II - Patch's London Adventure), the ending leaves lose-ends all over the place, a couple of caged animals are left there to rot despite helping the boring ""hero"" boy and saving his life, but either way, these lose ends don't even bother me because I cared so little about the story and characters here that what happens to them in the end matters to me not. The thing that bothered me the most was how the film had Bernard and Miss Bianca engaged in the end, I was like WHAT?! That's a bucket of cold water and a knife stabbed onto Margery Sharp's heart! She never would have allowed that to happen in her stories. Absolutely sickening.There's many other flaws with the film besides the boring, copied story, the tasteless comedy and the empty characters, but the bottom line is, stick to Margery Sharp's books and Disney's 1977 film, avoid this at all costs."
63,The Rescuers Down Under,8,2 May 2016,"The most overlooked film of the official Disney Renaissance, and possibly the best Disney sequel","This film was relatively unpopular due to being released between The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, but like the Nostalgia Critic says, it is one of Disney's most under-appreciated and underrated films. The Rescuers Down Under is a substantial improvement over The Rescuers (at least in my opinion) due to having more engaging action (the flight scenes are just magnificent), better characters (I found the new characters and their development to be more intriguing), and funnier comedy. I didn't really care for Madame Medusa, Brutus, and Nero, but I could say the opposite for Percival McLeach and Joanna. They were more dark and threatening than Medusa and the crocodiles, and had a better way to be removed from the story (I am not a fan of ambiguity, though I don't know if that would add to The Rescuers' score, subtract from Down Under's score, or both). The best part is that this sequel was made before Disney Sequels were even established as the company's toilet, and the sad thing is that just because it's a sequel, people are looking over it in favor of other Renaissance films. (Keep in mind that this was released 4 years before The Return of Jafar, the first thing considered a Disney Sequel.)"
64,The Rescuers Down Under,,13 October 2015,The forgotten Renaissance film,"The second film of the so called Disney Renaissance and the only one of them not to be a musical. And because of that, often a very overlooked and forgotten film. Which, I suppose, makes sense. All of the other Renaissance films are certainly more memorable than this one, and are such an integral part of the childhood of anyone who grew up in the 90s.But this film certainly has a lot of good things going for it. The animation, for one, is absolutely gorgeous. The first scene alone, with a long, zooming shot over the outback, is worth the price of admission alone. The flying scenes and the variety of gravity-defying camera angles are also stunning in multitude of ways, the character designs are both creative and flawless, the colours are vibrant and the whole film has a really good feel to it.It's also both nice and very odd to see a sequel in the actual Disney canon. Not that I approve of Disney sequels in general, for obvious reasons, but if you had to make one for any film in the Disney legacy, The Rescuers is one of the stronger candidates. I mean, the original film ends in a cliffhanger of all things.Unfortunately the film suffers from almost the same problems the original film did. The story, while perfectly passable, is not very exciting, especially when compared to the other Disney films of the time. A kid is in danger and somehow it falls to two mice to do the rescuing. The plot is mostly an excuse for some action scenes, a lot of character-based oddness and for the nice animation to shine. Which is fine, don't get me wrong, but it's simply not all that ambitious.The characters are also once again equally bland. The eponymous rescuers, Bernard and Miss Bianca, are both fine, but nothing overly special. The villain is a nice deviation from the norm, but fails to be very memorable. The supporting characters are probably the best thing about this film, aside from the animation, but even they can't hold a candle to other Disney side characters that debuted in the 90s.And that's The Rescuers sequel. It's good, but not great. A fun little adventure for the children, but lacking that spark that would make you watch it again and again even as an adult."
65,The Rescuers Down Under,5,28 March 2015,Meh,"TV Guide said of this movie, ""Three years in the making, it was obviously conceived during the height of this country's fascination with Australia, brought on by Paul Hogan's fabulously successful Crocodile Dundee. By 1990, the mania had long since subsided, and... the film doesn't make particularly imaginative use of the location. Take away the accents and the obligatory kangaroos and koalas, and the story could have taken place anywhere."" That's about it: lack of imagination. The formulaic repeats and nods to the original film aren't too cleverly woven into the new context and setting, and the resulting product is rather jumbled and, unless you are a young child, unsatisfying.The (few) attempts at more sophisticated gags to appeal to a cross-generational audience don't fit well in with the story or the rest of the movie, while they were pretty much seamless in the original. The writing is overall rather sloppy and it doesn't seem much thought was given to conceivability (the reviewer who pointed out the stupidity of Jake wanting to ""find a way to extend the runway!"" and then immediately making use of a device clearly placed to do just that was spot-on). Granted, a story involving anthropomorphic animals is not going to attempt verisimilitude, but surely it is not too much to ask that a fantastical universe, within its own world, obey certain rules of logical coherence.There's something else: the snow take-off. This had already been done in the first movie, and with quite effective animation and beautiful drawing (with the ""camp"" elements such as the albatross's snow boots extremely well-placed). The only reason to re-do it here was to capitalize on the techniques that had by 1990 evolved to allow ""sleeker"" and ""smoother,"" more metallic, flowing visuals and movement as was the aesthetic vogue at the time. Watching it in 2015, it is now apparent the animators made a huge mistake, and banked the differential of the new visuals largely on their technical acuity. Graphical rendering and automated animation have of course advanced considerably since that time, and consequently the updated scene has aged extremely poorly. (Also, without giving away too much, may I just say that the kind of mishap this incident leads to - and treats so cursorily and incidentally - is not funny to adults, and children should not be conditioned to think it is funny, either?)But maybe that was to be expected for a film so obviously conceived, from the start, as a consumer product catering to the fads of its time. Like all such films, this one was doomed to become a prisoner of its time. This has become abundantly clearer as the years have rolled by, and as such, it cannot be classed with the best, ""timeless"" Disney classics."
66,The Rescuers Down Under,6,22 December 2014,Rescuers Return,"Entertaining sequel to ""The Rescuers"" sees Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor back to voice the characters of Bernard and Bianca mouse of the rescue service, which operates out of the UN to help children in need, and in this tale a young boy living in Australia has been abducted by an evil poacher called Mr. McLeach(voiced by George C. Scott) who wants the boy to lead him to a large and rare eagle that he wants to kill, but the boy refuses. It is up to Bernard and Bianca to save the day again... Though not as charming and moving as the first, this still is a respectable effort, with a worthwhile message and an ambitious visual approach. Shame there wasn't a third adventure..."
67,The Rescuers Down Under,7,5 September 2014,"A Fast, Fun Family Adventure","Whenever or not you're going to love or hate this movie depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for character, relationships, and development, then The Rescuers II blows. Everything is simple, nobody develops, and most of the characters are played for laughs. You won't find anything to take away here.But if you want a well-paced, impressive adventure, Rescuers is pretty good. You don't need to stay for 5 minutes to see wonderful animation used on exciting, creative scenes. There's a lot stuff in this relatively short movie, and it doesn't feel excessive. The backgrounds of the Australian outback are nice, and the 3D animation is incorporated well when needed. The good guys are charming, the evil villain is intimidating, and we have a giant bird! If you're in the mood for that kind of nostalgic fun, then its a great treat."
68,The Rescuers Down Under,7,4 January 2011,Worthwhile,"As a kid, I owned both the original The Rescuers and its less financially successful sequel, The Rescuers Down Under, on VHS. Although the original film was the more acclaimed of the two, I found myself putting in the second film more. I preferred the sequel...and still do.It fits roughly in the Great Mouse Detective area of Disney's output, not ranking among its best while still providing some solid action/adventure entertainment. Co-director Hendel Butoy, inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Laputa: Castle in the Sky, set out to create his own adventure movie, and draws copious inspiration when it comes to the flight scenes and the liberal use of creative mechanical devices. Unfortunately, Butoy didn't incorporate the things that made Laputa a great film, such as its compelling relationships and themes of Nietzschian tyranny, and The Rescuers Down Under remains hindered by its superficiality. As pure adventure, however, it's great eyecandy and quite thrilling.Plotwise, this outing opts to focus more on the subject rather than the rescuers themselves. God knows Cody's not a complex protagonist, and can best be described as the young version of the lost Australian Planeteer (even though he doesn't have an Australian accent...nor for that matter does the villain...weird). His naive boyscoutness is kind of charming, but it's a bit ironic that the sequel that did what the original film should have has less compelling material to do it with. Once more, though, the villain comes to save the day. George C. Scott plays one of the most sadistic and manic of all Disney's villains, sometimes being played up for laughs but mostly letting us now just how credible it is that he could murder this kid for the sheer fun of it. He's a bit like what Captain Hook should've been. Bernard and Miss Bianca mostly pull off the same old schtick, but they're side characters this time out, and I'd be hard pressed to name why Bernard's troubles with proposing are relevant to the story. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to just make an adventure movie in the outback and had to tack them on and make this a sequel to get the film made.Really, that's all there is to it, and one's tolerance for the story depends on how much one is willing to set aside the weaknesses of the whole product in favor of the small bits, which are quite wonderful. The real asset of this film is its setting. Right from the opening scene in the deep underbrush and its sweeping long take across the outback, the filmmakers fetishize the hell out of their setting. Little animals and insects all over the place (some of them look a bit like Stitch...no surprise since Chris Sanders was a character designer here), detailed background work, and survival gadgets and machinations galore (which they use for set pieces whenever they can), the passion that went into the craftsmanship is apparent. It's a major leap forward from The Little Mermaid in terms of animation.Character animation is very solid all around, but the showstopper is probably the early flight sequence with Marahute, handled by Glen Keane, which still impresses mightily on a technical level and remains visually beautiful and inventive (probably the best of the film's ""bits""). The other standout is Kathy Zielinsky's work on McLeach. An early lead role for her, she pulls off some very Bill Tytla-ish animation and gives a unique sense of shape and presence to the character. Her inexperience shows through a bit, but it's still very good work from one of the most underrated character animators around. Again, major improvement from the last Disney film, but not quite golden age quality.I can't really fault people for overlooking this one, since it isn't really great storytelling, but there's enough good character and ambient stuff here for me to recommend animation buffs at least check it out if they haven't already. It certainly didn't deserve to bomb like it did, and it's very important in Disney's evolution (as their next film would be arguably the best of the whole renaissance). I loved it as a kid and it hasn't quite worn off."
